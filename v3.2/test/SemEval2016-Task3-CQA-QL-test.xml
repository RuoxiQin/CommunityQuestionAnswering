			<RelCText>Kat yep very true about the type of work you are experienced in; if the position can be filled local the mindset is.....why hire a American that will want more salary then a different nationality? Wasta; I have but lol kat i dont have the right wasta so im out of here. even with a catchy; professional cv it all came down to wrong visa. lol and they say being American with upon arrival visa is transferable.... ya right.... Can u be my wasta? It is EASY if you are on husbands rp; just need patience as this is Qatar they move slow in HR; but they get over 100+ applications a day. IF your CV is eye catching and has what they need; you will get a call for interview.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>well maybe if there wasn't 1 billion of you guys trying to take the same job from those few companies. Yet the new generation is also going crazy enrolling in IT degrees... How many IT jobs you think there are in this place? Unix and Linux are jobs for men in here.. Yes believe me; certain jobs are dedicated for each gender... an IT company that needs a Unix admin; that is 99.99% male dominated department would NEVER hire a woman.

			<RelCText>Kumar; Well; you can come and take a chance; there are jobs available for Indians but as you said; it is not that easy or abundant. Still your luck and merit counts. Better try to stay for 3 months; in 1 month nothing will materialise unless you know some big shots to take care of you. But do not resign your current job. Hold on as standby. PS: Oil price coming down or LNG price going up etc.; nothing to do with Qatar; they are well stabilized for next 50 years. Good luck.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>  Try hotels like marriott; ritz-carlton; sheraton; etc. Bayt.com is also good. you can also check the web site for the newspapers; like www.gulf-times.com and check their ads section.

			<RelCText>I am not sure on what condition you are going to move to Doha; but it looks like both of you guys don't have a job in Qatar... So actually you have to star from searching job. As has been mentioned; try to browse Internet for the advertismenets. Then you can get phone/fax numbers and e-mails of particular hotels; and send your CVs directly to these hotels. When you find the job; the Comapany will issue visa for you; and only after that you can come to Qatar.

			<RelCText>I would apply via agency and directly to the company. there's nothing preventing you from doing both - apply via agency first (they will probably ask you if you already applied through another agency or directly for this role - then you say NO (which is true :o)... and then apply directly to the company. Why? Because you have no guarantee that the recruitment agency actually presents your CV to the company. So to have best chances - go for both! good luck!</RelCText>

			<RelCText>just like how the recruiting agent gets a commission for every candidate being recruited through them; a small percentage goes to the HR under the table for recruiting the candidate through them.....

			<RelCText>I am just trying to understand. Your ticket allowance - will they pay you for your ticket on a monthly basis? or will they only give you QR1000 when you are leaving to go home? Sorry your breakdown doesn't make any sense. I get the Basic Salary and Car Allowance and Housing.... What is a ticket allowance 1000; market adjusment 3500; furniture allowance 25000? Are they giving you money to furnish your home? You might as well pocket that money and use it towards getting furnished apartment - which for a 2 bedroom is about QR8;000 - If you are only earning QR13;500; your salary diminishes drastically and you are only left with QR5;500 for a Car; monthly utilities; groceries; school fees and entertainment.... and if you are only getting QR1000 for your airticket home; then you are going to need to save for the rest of your ticket and that of your wife and child.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"Hello; i am egyptian as well but older than you. Listen you can accept the offer but do not expect to save a lot as you will pay almost 4000 for rent; about 1500 to 2000 as car monthly installment &amp; about 3000 at least for monthly expenses without having too much fun. so you will be able to save about 1000 USD per month which is fine for somebody in your age. but if you are expecting to save more then do not come or ask for more.For furniture allowance it is going to be depriciated over 4 years but they will not pay it to u every for year check with them again;for end of year profit share do not expect more than two to three month for the basic maximum. also for promotions it is not that easy may be after 3 or 4 years.So you may accept the offer to gain the gulf expriance then you can start searching for another job in gulf as they always say for egyptians "" you do not have gulf experiance"""</RelCText>

			<RelQBody>If the red light turns red while in the middle of intersection; is it considered jumping the red light? If you stop past the white line; is it considered jumping the red light? My husband told me that if you stop past the white line; even if you did not cross the intersection; the sensor will detect your car as beating the red light. Is it true?

			<RelCText>I have been flashed twice at the Toyota Tower Signals for jumping the red light but luckily the cameras are still in the testing phase. Not all those ugly speed cameras are fully operational. They havent all yet been connected to the ministry of interior's sever. Once I was behind a truck at a signal and I couldnt see whether it was green or red when I was crossing. These huge trucks block the sight of the signals. They have to do something about it. Anyways I would definitely advise people not to jump redlights and slow down at the singals.</RelCText>

My colleague told me that in Australia; if you stop past the white line; the camera will take photo and repeat it after a few seconds.

If amount is there on the car number during the period u have rented then rent car company will recover from you. did they block a specified amount from your credit card?

			<RelCText>From my personal experience - The Camera will only flash once you Jump the Red Light which means over the zebra crossing. If you happen to cross the zebra crossing in flashing Green or Yellow you will be lucky enough not to get the picture taken. My sister jumped a Clear Red signal at 38 kms per hr speed and she had to 6000QRS and 7 points on the Drivers license. The traffic dept will have a clear video and recording of the incident which you can verfy with. I hope this does not happen to you. Just in case do check this website on timely basis to know of any violations. http://www.moi.gov.qa/site/english/ Good Luck</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Traffic rules 101 - Red means to STOP ... So; If you've crossed the lights while anything but red; you are good. Some people are extra cautious and stop when the green starts to blink (that is just a personal choice) because the fines are just too hefty. But they risk getting rammed from the behind if they brake suddenly. You can pass through even on amber; but it is just not worth taking that risk. Best is to always reduce speed while approaching the lights.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Don't generalize your own habits to everybody in here. plus if you don't have any idea about a subject just stay quiet. camera flashes when you pass over the sensors which are installed just on pedestrian walkway in front of you. its not necessary to cross the whole signal to get flashed. my case was exactly the same; happened in small signal near apollo polyclinic. i went over the pedestrian walkway by the same mistake and then returned. i believe he didn't cross the signal coz the opposite side traffic was flowing. camera takes two snapshots plus a short video. even if they fine; he can appeal and video is his proof.</RelCText>

Customer service tell me to enrol in some wafa points but both the website and contact number of wafa do not work if i wish to enrol. Awesome.

			<RelCText>Dear and beloved brother in Islam; it is not the concept of banking per say which is forbidden in Islam; but it is the concept and dealings of ‘riba’ which forms the very back-bone of conventional interest-based banks; which is absolutely forbidden in Islam by Allah and His Messenger (saws). The Islamic Banks or Islamic Financial Institutions are all based on Shariah-compliant interest-free dealings; and it would be absolutely permissible for a believer to seek employment in an Islamic Bank; if he wishes to do so. Islamic way of banking: Most people are so used to the conventional interest-based banking system; that in their ignorance of the laws of Shariah-compliant Islamic Economics they may at times accuse the Islamic Financial Institutions of dealing in interest or ‘riba’ with just a different name. A simple example can be cited to make the concept of ‘haraam’ and ‘halaal’ clearer. If one marries a woman and satisfies his pleasure; it is considered ‘halaal’ and .....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Dear people in Islam thankyou every one of you for your valuable answers. i did a little research on this topic and i came to know that; no matter whatever the banks are. if their capital has riba involved in it and if the banks are dealing with riba ; then the business is haram. it depends on what they are dealing with. for example - all ''Q'' companies are dealing and doing business with some product so their business is halal but when some company does liquor and riba and other haram things involved in it ; then it becomes haram. i also found this that: in olden days the trade used to take place between products like rice for wheat; or rice for milk or rice for sugar or other dealings which is halal; then came currency : wheat for dirhams; dirhams for rice which still is halal but when the currency came in like 1 kg of good quality gold for 3 kg of bad quality gold and people started this thing and started to cheat in this currency to currency to gold to gold ; or good quality wheat.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>It could very well be true. Qatarization is a very high priority here. But with that said; saying that Qataris should fill secretarial positions and getting them to do so are two different things. A national is going to have to want the job before the job is Qatarized. I'm not sure how this would be handled so I don't see it happening overnight. I'm not sure if this refers to replacing people already in positions or for new positions opening up. One would like to think that expats will keep their job until their contract runs out at least. Also - it could be that a qualified Qatari is given first opportunity at a new position and if it isn't filled then it can be opened up to expats. In any event - it will take time to sort out.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"I can see it happening overnight indeed. In my organization we have four administrative positions sitting empty that have been reserved for Qataris. No one wants them; we had one woman for a while; but she quit after a month as her husband thought that it was too far for her to drive. What silliness; we can't hire anyone to fill the positions as they are reserved for Qataris; but we can't find any Qataris willing to take the jobs; and nothing is getting done. Why are administrative positions considered to be ""unskilled"" anyway? A good admin assistant is worth their weight in gold."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"the ""pecking"" order for jobs has always been Qatari first; second was other arab and third was any other nationality.

HR and its systems can slowly deteriorate with no apparent effect......until the system does collapse and by then it's often too late. Enter the expats again to sort things out. One comment.

			<RelCText>thanks to everyone (except 120kpm@roundabout) for your answers. this is my second trip to doha and normally i'm in dubai when in the middle east; where they are still serving alcohol in restaurants from 19.30. last time i was in doha quite a lot of people told me how doha is as liberal as dubai; because of the amount of expats there; so i did think that the hotels where tourists and business expats would be would make exceptions as they do in dubai. i have no problem not drinking; i am not much of a drinker anyway. just sometimes is nice to have a bottle of wine over dinner. 120kph; i don't appreciate being called an idiot. i wasn't asking for drugs or prostitutes or anything morally or legally wrong. i asked an innocent question about a city that i've only been to once before and your comment was uncalled for.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>If you mean if any one has adopted from QAWS recently. Then our experience was not so Good. We unfortunately adopted a kitten that had ringworms and had rash on her nose and other parts of the body. The new kitten gave all of the family ringworm rash leaving permanent marks on the body from this. We have had her treated and now she is fine. Where as we fully understand that QAWS is a fully voluntry organisation; but we feel that they could have advised us more about the health of the little kitten.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"Ukeng; I think you were told that this kitten had been suffering from ringworm; in fact if I remember rightly you were asked to return at a later date when it had cleared up. If I remember we said ""as far as we can tell it has recovered"". Not being vets we have NEVER told an adopter that the animal they are adopting is 100% fully fit and healthy unless they have been to a vets. We have apologised for any inconvenience and even offered to take the kitten back into the shelter which you declined. It's just a shame that the one or two negative experiences people have seem to overwhelm the hundreds of animals we rescue and rehome successfully."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>The players decide who goes first; perhaps via ip dip; (American: Eeny; meeny; miny; moe) or a variant; then the jacks are scattered loosely into the play area. The players take it in turn to bounce the ball off the surface; then pick up jacks; then catch the ball before it bounces twice. There are variants on this procedure. Sometimes the ball is thrown into the air rather than bounced. Sometimes it is bounced against a wall or target; if that is in the vicinity of play. Sometimes no bounce is allowed at all. In some variants; the players must pick up as many jacks as possible in each turn. Perhaps more commonly; the number of jacks to be picked up is pre-ordained and sequential: at first you must pick up one (onesies); next two (twosies); and so on. In most versions of the game; only one hand may be used. To simplify play; both may be used; to make it harder; or to impose a handicap; a player might be required to use their off-hand (eg; the left if right-handed). http://en.wikipedia......</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I've been there only once; but I can't remember the place. It is kind of tricky and not that easy to be found. I tried to post earlier but I was disconnected and it seems that my post is not here. Man you can pay at any time but before renewing your car registration. When you go for that they will ask you to clear all the violations that you got. First time I hear about the 10% thing; might be a new thing but never hear of it. The guys are right as well as the Airport one is less crowded than the Khalifa branch. You can also pay for that in 'Giant Stores' or 'Villagio' as I remember. I saw an office there for the Traffic Department. There is also in 'Hammad Hospital' down there near the Parking area down there. It is empty all the time. Good Luck</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Ngourlay makes some very good points that any person thinking of investing should seriously consider. I've been looking into the number of people coming to Qatar and the supply of property for some time. What is interesting is that demand is likely to continue to outstrip supply for the next 4-5 years. After this point; the Pearl; Lusail and other developments will come fully on stream and then I suspect property prices will come down as there will be enough supply. But on the other hand; Qatar is similar to how Dubai was in the mid 1990s. The potential is really impressive in the long term so real estate in Qatar is a good investment. As far as Lusail goes - I've consistently heard that it is running behind schedule and will not be completed on time. The first new development which will be ready seems to be the Zig Zag towers in June/July. They still have a couple of apartments left near the top I hear so it might be a better investment than Lusail given delays etc.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>You should not compare it to Dubai since prices in dubai when they statred selling 5 years ago were low and there was a big potential for buying; in Doha; a 2 bed appartment is selling for the same price as in dubai now; so even though there will be some upward potential; i dont think its enough to take the risk second; when i first came here in january i was interested in buying and i went to see the buildings with al sabban towers and they said that out of three towers they still have one to be sold; 6 months later they still had few appartment in that same tower; and now they are also selling the other two which were still not sold; in dubai; a compound of 6000 villa was sold in three days. third; between the pearl and lusail and waab cilty finishing all together; i dont think that doha is ready to fill all these empty appartments with such an inflation and people are starting to lok for other alternatives than doha I always tell the truth; even when I lie</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I have brought on the zig Zag about 7 months ago; and it has gone up so say 300;000 ryals. Not bad I hear you say but its paper money till you sell it; and I don't yet see an emerging sales market. Personally I am torn now; sell when the towers are finished take a quick profit OR Rent and hold on to it long term. Right now I am looking at the former; if i can make even 200;000 I am happy as that is more than the bank would have given me. We shall see; I would recommend zig zag purely because it will be finished first; the Pearl looks good long term and will be desirable. If al Wabb is cheap then great; get in. Loisil well that really is a lonnnnng way off; at least 5 years in my opinion before it would be worth it. but as a long term bet it could be good and might actually be a better bet than the Pearl as I think that NOW its over priced. Some friends got in when prices were lower; but now is is crazy money and there will be A LOT of towers down there.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"Dear aviduser; actually the same question as already posted by navi ...""what is the situation for residence permit?"" are you getting it straight after the purchasing property or need to wait until it's completion; or even something else. How is the law and rules work here? You advise will be very valid for me; since I'm too new for this place. Congrats; for your purchase but now I'm totally confused whether it's worthy to look for Lusail or not? All these buildings won't be finished before 2010;so no return from any of the investment upon that time; which makes bank loan too heavy for me.

			<RelCText>"So you hold both. But it means that you don't need exit permits any more. Then if you quit your job you can stay move job do whatever. This all sounds great I know but I am thinking that if you tell an employer you don't need to be sponsored they may not hire you as they have less control over you. In my case getting rid of the Exit permit thing is a big bonus. Zig Zag two beds are up now for about 1.9 million they were 1.6 Rental returns well I don't know; compared to Beverly Hills tower where the average is 18K I am hoping for 14-16K Hopefully. Loisil is so long away the financing in this country does not make any sense. Dubai was mentioned earlier; what people fail to mention with that ""boom"" is flats were offered with very low down payments and then nothing until completion. This meant people with enough cash could secure hundreds of apartments each they then sold the options on these flats on for a little profit and on the cycle went; with only the person holding the flat at the c....."</RelCText>

			<RelQSubject>Expats buying property in Qatar</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>Have any expats on this forum either bought property in Qatar; or considered buying and then rejected - i.e zig zag towers; the Pearl etc ? I'm trying to evaluate whether or not this would be a good investment. What do you think are the potential risks and upsides ? If you have bought; what was your experience of the process and in hindsight; was it a good decision ? Regards</RelQBody>

			<RelCText>Personally.. i think the real estate industry may start a down slide soon; it seems like Rents have skyrocketed within the last year or two; It is likely that the asian games had soemthing to do with this and i just can not imagine the prices of real estate maintaining this insane rate for much longer. Something has to give. On the flip side of the coin; Qatar has been and still is expanding at a fast rate; there could continue to be a growth spurt and that would mean that more housing would be needed for workers... I'm absolutly no help am I? lol~ sorry :(</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I just brought on Lagoon Plaza; so I am hoping the market doesnt come down anytime soon. Personally while all this building is going on and while there is a buzz about the place then I think prices for property will keep rising. I was reading a Dubai site the otherday saying prices are beginning to drop due to over supply. I think that problem is a long way off here. Plus I brought because my company will give me a housing allowance so they will be paying for my investment and when you look at it like that its a no brainer. Icidently I did look at the Pearl it is going to be very nice but just not soon enough and I think they are a bit over priced.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Hey. I looked at a place on the Pearl in Sabban Towers; which will be the first completed tower on the pearl. I; unfortunately couldn't get the finance fast enough so i lost the apartment; the tower is now sold-out. Property prices are rising roughly 10% per month at the moment and trust me that is not going to slow down in a hurry. They just will never beable to build fast enough to catch up with the demand as has happened in Dubai. I definitely think it is a good invetsment; even if the appreciation on the property slows down to 10% per annum that is still a good investment when you condsider the fact that you are currently just pouring your rent money into someone else's pocket or mortgage and you could be putting that into your on property which you can redeem when you sell the place. For at least the next ten years your investment will be very safe; that being said who knows what will happen if America goes after Iran? There is no return without risk though as i am sure you know a.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>What is the problem; I would maybe have a few doubts about the Pearl just becasue its reclaimed land but my tower built on solid ground out of concrrete. I think it will be ok for some time to come. The finishing in this country is appauling but you can't argue that the building are not solid.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Property even in the building I have brought in has gone up 20% since its launch. The Pearl is adding 10% to each phase. Its going to keep going; and you are right why should my company put rent money into someone elses pocket when they can pay towards my mortgage. I am happy with 10% apprication on the property. I would have got 5% in the bank and realistically its going to be more than that. 10 years is probably about the right amount of time to keep hold of it. By then you will have Loisil Wackra Al Khor etc all built and it will be an established market. Until then I am holding for the ride.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I am now considering Lusail as an option but i am wondering if it is going to be too far out initially and will show a slower appreciation. I have seen it happen in Dubai; the original western villa area is the Springs and Meadows near the Dubai Marina and the Palm Jumeriah. They have subsequently built the Arabian Ranches and while the Springs etc has continued to appreciate dramatically the Ranches is struggling a bit. Now i believe that the lagoons and the Pearl will soon become the centre of Doha and Lusail will be the suburbs do you think the places there are going to hold their value as well as the Pearl? Whats your opinion; i would be interested to know as you seem to have the same ideas about the property market that i do?</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"You sound pretty vague in your confidence; When you say ""I hope"" and ""I think"" but you conclude pretty confidently with the term ""no-brainer"". The prices of Lagoon are above a million for a one bed appartment. Such prices in the heart of Dubai Marina have now crashed to 0.55 million. Still Dubai has a higher brand equity and better business environment. I am sure you might have done much more research and assessment of the scenario before getting in. Please elaborate further on your analysis. Anyone who buys is pretty convinced of his moves specially when there is no clarity on ownership and legislation. The other factor that has literally killed the Dubai market is the very high figure of Annual maintenance charges of about 10AED/Sq ft/Year. Please share your analysis with us. PS: I am not critiquing or analysing your decision to buy. I am only seeking more information that you may like to share with us on your analysis. Quiet lurker. Poor Contributer"</RelCText>

			<RelCText>don't believe the stupid people who say it's ok to not pay the loan. the insurance does not cover termination. when you applied for a loan; there normally is a clause in your salary letter (depending on where you're employed) saying that it is your employer's responsibility to inform the bank that you are leaving their services and/or your final dues will be paid to your bank account with them. you may need a clearance letter from the bank before you are able to leave qatar permanently. you may be able to get away with a simple exit permit but you might become blacklisted and might never be given a visa to enter qatar or even the gcc again. also; they might have ways to find and go after you; you never know.</RelCText>

I also read somewhere that the Qatar Armed Forces Medical Services is hiring thru unistaff so better check there.

			<RelCText>Well; I just 3 different banks to check out my options and they all said that we need to make a downpayment of 20% from the car's selling price. Unless; you are a Qatari and for our case - I think none of us is a Qatari ( I am assuming ) I think your next best thing to do now is to find a bank that has a great service and interest rate.

If you are western I would say you wont save much out of 20k; you would want a decent apartment / villa; good social life; weekends away. If you are the sort of person who is just coming here to work work work; then you will be able to save more.

			<RelCText>I see a lot of people have already written a reasonable answer; but keep in mind following: - about flat or car rental - depends who negotiates. If a European person or a westerner in general - forget it to find those rates. For them everything is double. - as many have mentioned - depends on lifestyle. For example one of the most difficult issues for women here - to find a normal hairdresser; beautician; etc. usually too expensive and very low quality / level of hygiene. If you go to a normal place - prices are ridiculous for what you get.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>should be making more than 20;500 per month. But that salary is certainly enough to live well on and to save quite a bit on (assuming you won't have a lot of other expenses). Benefits? No taxes! free furnished housing (probably doesn't include utilities -- check on this) free LOCAL medical (note that this is ONLY for local govt. clinics and Hamad Hospital; not the better private clinics in town where folks speak English; and it will NOT cover you when you return to your home country of origin in the summer -- be warned! It should also include free schooling for any kids you have (you don't say if you have any) -- and again; tuition here varies widely; so you need to know their cap on the dollar/riyal amount because I am SURE they would never pay to send your kids to the American School or something that cost more than; say; QR 25;000/year. Here's where some extra expenses might figure into the mix... So; not bad; but that salary is rather low for a PhD.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>It all depends on your lifestyle and what you are coming for. You can blow off 9000Qr in a week; a month; or be able to save up to 4000 QR out of it per month. You can rent a car for around 1600-1800 QR per month; but I would recommend buying a second hand car or a brand new one if you plan to stay here for 3-4 years; and you can pay around 750-1000QR per month and own the car. For food and personal expenses; 2000-3000QR is what you need so you will end up having 1000QR to shop with ; and 4000QR to save! Email me if you need more info; use my profile to email me.

Package offered to you would be based on EN02 grade which is among the best in middleast; anybody who says otherwise is not fully aware of ENG package (Support staff package is crappy). Slight variation would be based on your approvals; more you have more you earn. You will make good money on side because of overtime. Beast666</RelCText>

			<RelCText>One of the major dilemma a prospective employee faces is his / her salary requirement. During the interview process; an applicant realise how good he / she was in answering questions being raised. An applicant should be able to impress HR that he is not only the best candidate but the only suitable candidate for the job. If you are able to impress HR then you can demand. How much you are worth? It all depends on YOU. Every company has a salary scale (minimum - maximum) for each and every job however; if you are worth more; demand. Chances are; you can get it; depending on YOU.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>No you should not but it should normally come after the probationary period and should be requested by your manager. So rather than speaking to HR; may be you should ask your manager about it (if you are in contact with him/her).

First of all they were supposed to do a hotel booking on my return ticket which wasnt even confirmed till the time i was at the airport waiting for someone to pick me up from the hotel. Secondly the hotel that they did put us up in was in some freaking god forsaken sh*t hole in Mumbai; that even the taxi drivers didnt know where it was. I mean the staff at the QA are totally useless since they fill them with all inexperienced FEMALES just coz of their good looks.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Depends on your position. 8;000 QR is quite less for an engineer. Most of Oil/Gas companies in Qatar gives up to 6 months probation periods; it depends upon your performance; maybe for only 3 months; you will get hired already as regular employee. After that; then you can bring your family in Qatar. For the other benefits; I have no idea; but probably its good because Rasgas is a big company. O.T.. When did you get the interview in Rasgas?

""But last night violence broke out when tens of thousands of people – some dressed as penguins and polar bears; carrying signs saying: ""Save the humans"" – took to the streets. The march had been organised to urge conference delegates to work out a binding deal to tackle climate change but was marred when a group of protesters threw bricks at police."""</RelCText>

			<RelQSubject>Expat wives in Qatar</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>Hi everyone; Very nice to meet you all. :) My wife and I are moving to Doha in about 3 weeks. As I'm going to be working most days; my wife and I are a little concerned about what she'll be able to do to keep her occupied during the day. We were thinking of getting her enrolled at an ESL school (she doesn't speak much English). Besides take courses; what do other non-expat spouses do to keep busy? Thanks everyone. Hope to meet some of you after we arrive!</RelQBody>

			<RelCText>Hi! Nice to meet you; hope your move goes well. It can be difficult finding things to occupy your time here; especially when you're new. I'm not sure where you're going to be living? I live in an apartment block with my husband and it has no communal areas so have found it hard to meet and get to know my neighbours. I think compound life is a bit more sociable? Anyway - a couple of ideas... The Intercontinental Hotel (the one near Katara; not Intercont. the City) has a special offer on Tuesdays and Wednesdays - ladies pay only 50 QR to access their pool / pool area. I take yoga classes with Yama Yoga http://yamayogastudios.com - they are lovely and might be another way to meet people? Also; not sure what nationality / language your wife speaks but there are a number of associations for different nationalities here. Buy a copy of Marhaba magazine when you arrive - they have an up to date list of them with contact details - so she could socialise with people who speak her language.</RelCText>

If she know painting or tailoring she can earn bit extra money by doing. If she had done any beautifican course she can join in any of the parlour. If she is found animals she can give some food and water to the street cats or birds. If you need a marhaba magazine i will give you a copy. Best of Luck and a pleasant stay in qatar.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>hello! i guess it all depends on what kind of person your wife is. maybe she likes to exercise then she can go to aerobics classes n stuff.. she can do yoga or she can even go to Ezdan and get a package or sth for gym and swimming pool and stuff. and it also depends where you're stayig.. she can even sign up for a website (QL let's say) where she can learn stuff abt the country and news about the country... and she can make friends maybe. she can visit the musuems here when she comes but after some time what i metionned is pretty much all! hope she likes it here :)</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I've heard that even if a married couple were caught kissing in public they would be penalized. Kissing in public; in general; is not recommended. Even if authorities didn't catch u; u would stared at and given bad looks; and I think we should respect the culture of the country we're in so I would say u shouldn't make a huge romantic scene in the mall if u can save it till home. I think to avoid all the hassle; just keep ur relationship discreet in public.</RelCText>

It's so beautiful; so green! :o) I've enjoyed gr8 weather there. lots of sunny warm days and even few rainy ones. hmm...lovely walks in the rain! It's nice when you go back and all the neighbours are happy and surprised to see you on the street; everyone welcomes you :o) you know what I mean guys. it feels so nice. about movies; sure we can go to the new place. i'm always open for suggestions. just are they playing anything good? If you're looking for a problem; you're probably gonna find one.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Winnie Park House has currently closed its waiting list for all years. I have two children at PHES and so far have been pleased. One is in year 10 and hates the uniform; the school the teachers..... I think he is settling in nicely. We had to wait until last week (end of Sept) to get a place for my daughter in reception year. But the facilities in the primary section are good. The class rooms are bright airey clean and inviting. They have canopyed areas for the children to play outside. The school is small (about 600 including secondary); but they are currently building further extensions for sixth form. They moved into these premises over a year ago. All the teachers I have met are enthusiastic and bubbly. The head teacher Mrs Brennan is very approachable and ameniable. They have a very pragmatic approach to education and have adopted the British healthy schools policy. There is no canteen so its invent as many ways as possible to make a sandwiche look interesting for the next 10 year.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I was just this morning talking to a colleague who has two kids at Park House as I am considering sending my own daughter there. The feedback is very positive. Good facilities (they have now got their new place and are no longer using the Russian Embassy building). Apparently the teachers are very kind but also exert a strong sense of discipline and manners (cell phones are not allowed). They have recently started offering the International Baccalaureate. Everything I have heard about Park House has been very positive.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Thanks very much you have really put my mind at ease. I currently work for Education here in the UK - it appears your approach to Qatar is much the same as mine - giving up the housework etc... and as for getting trim again I am also going to enrol in some slow toning classes! Did you find it easy to make friends in Doha. My husband has been there a week and could not even get to the beach on Friday as it was members only. Any suggestions for a place he can relax on his day off? He is waiting for us to get there to join clubs etc... Appreciate your help.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>My husband came over by himself and he found the first week awful. He nearly came home several times. If your husband likes a drink he could try Garveys or the Rugby club. Alot of british use these. I believe you have to join as a member or come with someone as a guest. Tell him to buy a copy of the Marhaba in Carrefours supermarket in City Centre. that lists all events happening in Q and where to go. It is updated every season. It is also available at Jarirs bookstore. What co. does your husband work for?</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I have emailed you directly as I am sure there is more knowledge you can share with me. Do you live in a villa or apartment. Our company has provided us with a new 3 bed apartment and I do not know what it will be like with a 7yr old; he is used to playing out on his bike etc... I suppose as I will not be working I will have to keep him occupied - any good places for children to play/met etc.. We already have a copy of Marhaba which has been useful. I think Ramadan is the biggest problem at the moment. My husband has a company vehicle but I think I will have to get a car to do the school runs etc.. do you think I could hire one initially? or lease? Who does your husband work for. My husband is working very long hours at the moment as they are so busy - keeps him out of mischief I suppose!</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Hi guys I couldt help myself but this topic has caught my attention; reason being is that we have an appointment with PHES school this week to enrol my two sons; im guessing one will be year 6 and the other year 8; from what ive heard about the school it has a really good reputaion and just been new to doha now 3 weeks werve been told that there are now spaces available; we did try doha but no luck there not until next year; so it will be interesting to see what happens; didnt realise getting your kids into a school in qatar would be more difficult than getting a job anywhwere in the country.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>This news seems true and school has expressed condolences and a holiday tomorrow. Really the school authorities need to be more responsible especially when they charge way too much in terms of special fee and all when compared to other schools in Doha. The facilities tey lack and the amount of negligence shown is too much. There is no conductor in most buses; even the ones in which small kids travel; and even after complaining to the school many times; there is no action. Many buses are hired and are driven by irresponsible drivers who dont care about anything. Another issue is the school building..which has been sooo long under planning and fund raising stage. What is the management of the school doing happily running their own businesses and draining all the money from the parents without giving anything back to the school.The school management should be held responsible for the extremely poor porta cabins in which they teach the junior wing and the lack of responsibility in issues r.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>In my humble opinion; you should refuse this job offer flatly and with no regrets... UNLESS: 1- You are 20-27 years old. 2- You are single and have no plans for marriage any time soon. 3- You are a fresh grad out of college and/or have no practical experience in the work field. Basically; accept the job ONLY if it's your entry job into the field after having graduated college recently. You know how to evaluate yourself more than anyone on the forum... this job offer does not sustain any kind of decent living and shouldn't be accepted by anyone unless they really have to. That's just my opinion. By the way; are you male of female? If you're female you might want to consider accepting the job. Sincerely; - DingDong</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"angel6975; Here are answers to some of your questions: Q1: ""Btw; how much would a person from the west expect?"" A: A WHOLE A LOT more than your offer; at LEAST double! I don't mean to sound racist; I'm only speaking of the reality of the workforce in the region; but don't waste your time comparing your offer to that of someone from the West. If you carry a Western country passport while you're originally from Singapore; then you should expect to be CLOSE (but not equal) to the offer someone from the west is going to get. Now; if you were carrying a Western country passport AND you are originally from the West (i.e. White or light-skinned) THEN you can expected to get the full advantageous treatment someone from the West gets. Again; I REALLY don't want to sound racist; but this is the reality of the market here. Q2: ""And what if it were a senior position?"" A: If it were a senior position AND they still offered you this sum and these allowances; then believe me; it's like a slap in the ....."</RelCText>

On the contract; you will find everything you need to know about your salary and benefits so I'm wondering why you are so confused. I don't recommend you to take the housing allowance hence accept the accommodation that QA will provide for you. If you are a bachelor; you don't need to spend 10K for a flat.

			<RelCText>Cactiflora i think ur better off working for Malaysia Airlines. I hear there's no job stability with QA; and thats something u dont want to be worrying about all the time. I dont understand they say that if you make one mistake your more then likly to be sacked; and i travelled by QA once and their services were totally F*ckall!! First of all they were supposed to do a hotel booking on my return ticket which wasnt even confirmed till the time i was at the airport waiting for someone to pick me up from the hotel. Secondly the hotel that they did put us up in was in some freaking god forsaken sh*t hole in Mumbai; that even the taxi drivers didnt know where it was. I mean the staff at the QA are totally useless since they fill them with all inexperienced FEMALES just coz of their good looks.</RelCText>

They told me that they sent my passport to the Qatar Embassy for Visa Stamping. After 1 week they called me and told me that my passport with the visa stamp is already in POEA for OEC. Today (Oct. 9; 2012) they called me and asking me to go to their office for the PDOS. Tom. (Oct. 10; 2012) will be my PDOS. My colleagues (also Biomedical Engineers) already have their plane tickets; they will leave on Oct. 13; 2012. I am hoping to leave sooner also (CROSSED FINGERS! :D). Patience is virtue.. I believe whining/complaining/getting angry/making endless calls to Ms. Marie will do us any good. Let's just wait for them to call us. Holding our papers/visa/passports won't make them richer neither won't make them any happier; those papers will just stack up in their office. They are just following the right process so.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"Wait and only apply to Doha English Speaking School. If they get accepted then leave the UK. This school is only British school which follow the actual British curriculum and is monitored by the British educational council. All the rest of the British school claim they ""follow"" the British curriculum. Who is there to monitor the school? If you PAY for a private company to accredit the school; they will come out and give you accreditation. You will find out that your child will be a year behind because majority of the schools don't have the textbooks for each subject in the class. Nor do they have a curriculum without textbooks or manuals. Sadly; the teachers have to deal with the parents as to why their child is behind because the Principal will pond you over to the teacher for any complaints."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>DESS although the best has LONGGGGG waiting list and is until primary. For me ; no harm putting them into the waiting list &amp; pray that you will get a place. To me there are other good ones like Doha College; Parkhouse; Sherbourne &amp; Doha British School which you can consider. Due to personal preference; I have seen parents transferring their kids within these few schools too. Alternatively you let your husband settled here first.. find a school before you guys come over. All schools require entrance exam before they are accepted. So whenever a place becomes available; do prepare to fly them immediately.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>There are some great new schools opening; for instance the International School of London or the American College School (though obviously not British curriculum).

			<RelCText>My husband also works for Qatar Airways. Now is an excellent time to apply for schools here as they are sorting places for Sept 2012. I am a teacher and it was a worry trying to get our daughter into a school. We arrived at the wrong time of year and it took a while to get her into a school so I had to home teach for a while. However; this time last year we got our daughter into Doha College. She has come on in leaps and bounds and we are thrilled with the school. The school has recently been inspected and did extremely well. They use the British Curriculum so the transition from UK to Doha College was very easy! Your children will need to sit an assessment but it's nothing to worry about. You will also need previous school reports from their current UK school. Other schools that we were impressed with were DESS and Sherbourne. Hope that helps! Good luck! :)</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"I disagree with Expatemily (I am a friend in real life with her) Park House is a great school. Also loads of Qatar Airway people. I have 3 kids in the school. Other good schools (based on my dealings with the schools and friends comments) are Doha (Montisori) British School; Doha Collage; Doha English Speaking School. These four schools are also ""reasonably"" priced. The American schools are crazy expensive. I suggest applying to all of those schools now (as in today!). Places often open up over the summer and Park House requires a deposit on next year from current students in May for September so you could still easily get places. Having 3 children is an advantage because one one gets a place it tends to bounce the others up on the waiting list."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"Everytime I log on here and see comments about schools I chuckle at the amount of best schools that are listed. To date I believe there might be about 6 ""best"" schools in doha; based on what; usually perception based on how well a particular child is doing at that school at that moment. It seems to me that if a child is struggling or not doing particulalry well then first thing to do is blame the school ""it must be the school"". A well motivated pupil will thrive in most environments and from what I have come across so far most of the schools are okay; as long as they are not for profit...we are never going to replicate a top british school but why would we want to as one of the benefits here is the multi culturalism. Of course places are tight but I dont think people should stress as much about the schools. I have a child of 13 who will either go to DBS or DC but personally I would have him in ASD (no chance) but not because the rest are rubbish just because I personally got a better f....."</RelCText>

			<RelQSubject>Hamad Medical corp Salary</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>hey guys. I`m a nurse here in the phils. i just signed a contract for hamad as a staff nurse. the offer is 5600 qatar riyals per month plus 1000 qatar riyal for transportation allowance. Is that a great deal? how about the free accommodation does it look good? I`m anxious about my new job. help pls.</RelQBody>

			<RelCText>Regarding the starting salary;if it is your 1st stint to work as nurse overseas; that looks to be fair.with regard to the transportation allowance of QR1;000/month it seem to be reasonable only if your accomodation and the hospital are located in the same city. i mean if you will be assigned in Al Khor or somewhere far and your accomodation is in Doha; then that might need to be adjusted. Hamad provide pretty decent housing or the other staff gets housing allowance. I am not a nurse but I know some nurse working with Hamad. Hamad is a government Hospital and in general they give higher salary than the private clinics/hospitals. Can you provide me Hamad's Agency and contact address in the Philippines as it could also be an option for my nurse daughter in the future. She just passed the nursing board exam and barely starting her 1st job this month.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"Your salary is fair enough for an entry level nurse; the question is where your accomodation will be. bachelor accomodation means you will be sharing with two to three persons per flat or apartment; nationalities of which you will be sharing it with will depend on the vacancies available. there are 4 HMC hospitals; plus one for openning this year; in doha all located in proximity of each other with one in far off al khor; if you will be assigned in al khor; your accomodation will be in proximity of AKH. its a different environment than back home; not all patients know english. Good luck! For Mr. Lucero; the agency that i know of is universal staffing services in makati located near south superhighway near border of makati and manila.

			<RelCText>hi Minoush; I think you probably tried these shops already; ie; mothercare;marks and spencer; BHS; Next. Yup selection is awful; and prices are ouch. Have you tried H&amp;M?

			<RelCText>I tried H&amp;M and their selection was ok. The only problem were the pants had this new fangled design where the waist is supposed to sit below your waist and it felt like my pants were about to fall down. Just too hip and cool for me. I'm old and I need mom jeans! :-) I will try BHS. I'm used to Target and discount stores. The idea of paying $80-$100 for a pair of pants that I will wear for 6 months is impossible. Checked online; shipping from Motherhood Maternity from the States is $70 for a ton of clothes. I think I will just do that.... Thanks ladies!

			<RelCText>hi Minoush; you will have to go to Mothercare at CC; because apparently all maternity wear from other MC shops are to shift to MC of CC; if not already there. You need to visit the MC inside Debenhams. The locals wear the abbaya; so a loose gown inside ( the jalabiyas; more like the house maxis) is not visible to anybody. Among Asian clothes there are many loose tops in style right now; with lycra tights; so again no problems there. Getting T's is not an issue; as long as you are okay with it hugging you tight all day. The trouser style; is the low bump style right now; and it doesnt really fall off.H&amp;M had the high waist trousers. not sure about baby shop for Maternity clothes; else you may have to try the large clothes section; like Evans; if you are looking for comfy tops. Check Giordano as well; they dont have maternity; but they usually have these loose comfy linen trousers that you can tie under the bump.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I agree - Pretty bad - even worse if you want to buy something for work. H+M are fine if you are looking for casual but that is it. BHS does not have a maternity section (I asked in the one in Landmark) and mothercare is very expensive - perhaps order over the internet?</RelCText>

And things are left for others to deal with...others; who don't really have anything to do with the problem in the first place. others; who; due to circumstance; don;t know what kind of evil they are dealing with...hence; are losing one battle after the other. Which leads us to the conclusion that those who are leaderless and ask ""what can we do"" are part of the problem.Non?"</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I don't think the problem is with HMC as far utilising the medical city building is concerned; but i don't know the details. Similarly; housing allowance is provided to everybody who is eligible or who's contract states housing allowance.

			<RelCText>Jackmphan They are know thinking about including the single status in the contract. I am just putting everything into picture; HMC hired many nurses in last 2 years. When they came they were offered either housing or housing allowance. Almost all took housing allowance; then they called their families on visit visa; once their husbands found a job in qatar; they want to forfeit housing allowance and instead they want a house from HMC. This means thousands of units and this is not an easy job and plus estimate the rent. By and large HMC has been favourable to its employs; i know many hospitals in gulf do not allow females to bring their families. Plus not so long ago; no organization in qatar was even giving housing allowance to females; they either get single accomodation or nothing at all.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>If I was moving; I would be looking at Qtel's Mozaic offering which is being advertised all over town on the bill boards. One gets telephone; broadband at 100MBs (I am not 100% sure on this speed; but its mega fast ) and televsion all through a telephone cable for something like QR 300 per month with a once-off installation fee.. There was an earlier discussion thread on QL when Qtel failed to roll out this Mozaic Tripleplay in December; but it seems they are ready. I cannot find any reference to it on their website; and I could only get info about it from the main Qtel branches. The kiosks in the malls will not be able to help you. These prices are very tempting compared with ADSL alone.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Hi man; I don't know for what do you want to use the internet connection; but: 1- If you want it only for browsing then get the [512KB] it is more than enough for browsing. 2- If you want it for browsing and watching online videos; download some stuff from here and there get the [1MB]. 3- If you are using the torrents to download movies; music and can't live your day if you did not download something; then get the [2MB]. The speed difference can be noticed when you start downloading from a static IP or a direct download. The range goes like: 1- [512KB] up to 80 if you were lucky; most of the time between 60 and 70] 2- [1MB] up to 120 but most of the time the range is from 90 - 110. 3- [2MB] up to 200 but most of the time the range is from 140 - 180. You should notice the download speed varies according also to the upload speed [especially torrent files]; if you start for example downloading 3 torrents in the same file and one of them was having an upload rate of your maximum connection.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Nice beautiful; if a bit unkept; manmade Island which served quite rightly to provide enterteinment to the desperate families who coldn´t afford to pay or couldn´t get into an expensive healthclub. Once day; someone very clever decides to destroy it; leaving instead a piece of sand with one tree in the middle. Rumours have been circulating about the next project that will take its place: a fountain; an acuatic IKEA; a swim-thru McDonals; the tallest building ever made; etc...but so far; nothing has happened and most probably nothing will ever replace that little oasis of entertainment in a city where there is absolutely nothing to do.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Two years ago; when I came to this country...someone lured me to go this this island one weekend. It costs only 20riyals (to and from the island; includes the entrance fee; i suppose)drow boat ride. There you can relax in a lounger under the shade of the trees; watching the others swin; play volleyball or the children play in the sand. And since the beach side faces to the sea...you'll feel like you're in a tropical island away from QATAR (my opinion). waiters are ready to take your food order. Read a book while you smoke sheesha. If you get hungry; there was a seafood restaurant for you to dine in... It was my small heaven; my recluse whenever I feel homesick; work-stressed or just plain lazy to do anything... NOW...IT'S JUST AN EMPTY ISLAND...and the tree there is not even a PALM TREE? :-( What you are is what you have been; and what you will be is what you do now. - Buddha</RelCText>

			<RelCText>this is Air Supply/non-westerner/The Che....(banned 14 times so far) What's wrong with parks; malls and driving away from Doha?

Isn't all this/the above the facts about a simple city life? To have these varieties? How about the lovely Souqs with their wonderful cafes? You will enjoy them so much &amp; spend very little. Who wants noisy nightclubs; they are available. Who want a quiet glass of wine; it's available (Golf Club for example); who wants a park; an old Souq; Cafes; Malls; Shops; far beeches; exclusive beeches...all available. Damn!

Been to nearly every corner of Qatar. And everything just sand and sand. Palm tree island one of my favourite place to take the kids. The beach there a bit rocky; but still better than nothing. There used to be a public beach next to Oasis; and now the build another hotel there (Sharq). Beach in Al Wakra not that good ... the only decent beach is inland sea which is quite long drive from Doha."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Hmmm Red Pope - well my friend was neither drunk nor obnoxious; and was celebrating with his wife and other friends. He actually rents a villa at Garvey's. Had just bought a bottle of champagne ready to see in the New Year when the police arrived. He had to leave it there so was a bit pissed off!! The DJ was telling people to leave; that it was not a joke. Maybe your friend was drinking at one of the houses/apartments on Garvey's compound?</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I've only been to one; but if you mean dull as dogshit when you say down and dirty; than I guess thats right. The parties are separated into two groups; men and women; and there is no alcohol (at least at the womens parties) they dance to loud disco music and dress scantily for other women while critizing what every other woman is wearing.

			<RelCText>"The men's part of the wedding is pretty straight forward. Invitees congratulate the groom and his father; brothers... You sit next to him for the traditional coffee and tea; have a picture taken with him. Later on there's a buffet and an ""'ardha"" which is a traditional sword dance. Very nice; beautifully decorated garments. After that groom goes to the women's party and joins the bride. At least these are my first-hand observations. There's no ""down and dirty"" part there."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>In my North American university they had the system of averaging out the grades. (It is a very complicated system; you cannot understand it and neither did I). So what happened was that I was failing; and in order to pass I needed to put all the other nerds in the course to sleep. But those jerks would study all day and never sleep and I was very much worried about the health effects on them for not sleeping. In the end I told my professor of the Pressure on those students; so he gave all of them A Grades and me got B grade. Here is what happened in the exam. After one hour had passed in the exam; he told us if anyone of you wants to leave; he can leave and he will get a B. So I happily left. I was the only one to leave. For the rest who stayed he gave all of them A for believing in themselves.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"Here's the content of the thread; You are probably all aware by now that there are new dress regulations in place in Qatar - the 4 and 5 star hotels were given 10 days to comply with the new rules which are that you must be ""appropriately dressed"" - no explanation of what this is but it seems to be no knees (even at night in nightclubs etc) and no shoulders. I've heard of people being refused entry to restaurants for having slits up their dresses and (in the case of a 14 year old) showing their knees. I've been told the shopping centres are also now turning people away for wearing halter necks etc (Landmark in particular). One friend just rang me to say that a group of her girlfriends were stopped from going into W last weekend - each of them had something ""inappropriate"" from cleavage; to knees to shoulders. You also have to now show either your ID card or passport for entry into bars and (the scary part) if you aren't dressed appropriately they take your ID card and scan it and send ....."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>In my company; most of the women are bankrolled by a Qatari. Nice cars; nice phone; given some pocket money (hush money); and have to be available when the guy slides up in his Land Cruiser and wants some extra marital loving. Is this prostitution? The line is blurred; right? They would say they are in a loving relationship...and they live; drive and eat beyond their means. It is why they came to the country; to snare a rich Qatari. If you report these women; they'll just deny and say it is their boyfriend; and that the money is a 'gift'.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"... but locals are obliged to wear it. I was told at work that they even get an allowance to wear the costume (not sure from the company or the state). They are not supposed to wear anything else while in Qatar. It is sort displaying that you belong to a certain race when you're in a minority situation; and i'm not going into the VIP territory again. As for western women wearing it; as long as you're not walking ""alone""; it should be OK. At the least you should be walking with another woman; preferably wearing the same. If you two get into a Landcruiser at the end of your walk; that's even better :) Moudir"</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Buddy; cheaper cars on rental basis are easy to find in Qatar but the car owners make very strict conditions. i had a bad experience for finding cheaper car like you on rental basis as there was a condition that if car involves in an accident and it's not my fault; i still have to pay the rent for car for the days it stays in garage. THAT'S REDICULOUS.... Big rent a cars like AVIS; BUDGET or THRIFTY etc. you don't have to worry about any thing bcz even you crash their cars; you just have to pay small amount as these cars are fully insured rather than those small rent a cars; who are just waiting for a prey (Customer) and suck all the money you have.... May be it's just me and i don't have any intention to discourage you to get a cheaper car if budget is a concern of yours. Have a safe and joyful weekend.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>For family with 2 child; you ll probably need 2BR flat which will cost about 7000-8000 and for schooling you ll probably need 4000-5000. so it means these two will take major chunk of your salary. Further you can take 3000 monthly living expense and 2000 for conveyance. Additionally any medical requirements. Now its upto you to decide...</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Aamirjaved's calculation is somewhat on the high side. I believe you should be able to get a 2BR within QR 5000 and also you can easily manage your monthly expenses within QR 2000. For the schooling; if you are an Asian; it is not that costly to my understanding. As such; my view is that if you are an Asian; grab the offer; but if you are a westerner; kick it.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>i actually had a treatment at the six senses spa; and it was fantastic! i would definitely recommend it. but of course; it would depend on what you value more...the price or the value. what the spa in ritz offer is different from four seasons and chakra. from what i know; the spa in ritz is managed by six senses; and the outlook is traditional; but still luxurious. six senses's products are really good; and their service is also great. if you have time (and money); definitely try all of them...its best to find one that suits you</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I bought a grand vitara last year XL7 it was for a good price. but i really regretted; the service of teyseer is the worst I've ever experienced: lousy; unhelpful service staff with disgusting facilities. I took me two visits to the service center before i give up and started taking it to other oil changing shops . besides; the car has many manufacturing defects (according to a friend he is still facing them in his new model): CD player; brake system... At the time when I bought it it was the only car with 7 seaters with a very reasonable price (67000); but finally It would have been better for me if i bought a pajero or a pathfinder.

			<RelCText>It depends on the brand. As a general rule most UK brands (such as BHS; Next; M&amp;S; H&amp;M) are priced at an exchange rate of QR7 to £1. As the current rate is closer to QR5 to £1 clothes will be cheaper in the UK. On top of this retailers are discounting heavily in the UK because of the recession. If you look at some French or Spanish brands (Zara) they are cheaper in Doha.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I agree that now the exchange rate is so low then clothes are deifnitely cheaper back in UK especially with the great sales that are on there at the moment.

			<RelCText>Qatar does not have websites for most commerce. Best car to drive depends on what you want to do; only town; off road; racing (to AlKhor and back). Prices are comparable to US cost. If you get a used car; be careful. Qataris are hard on cars. Try to find an Expat leaving town. Lease for a month; learn to drive here in somebody elses car; see what you can find and then buy.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>and unfortunately; the beast is the unregulated market in Qatar. There are now MANY landlords who are refusing to pay any commission to agents; and this has therefore led almost EVERY main agency in Qatar to start charging tenants. In THEORY; they should provide you with a great; professional service; though admittedly this is not always the case. The UAE has a regulatory body in place....but tenants pay 5% there in fees for EVERY deal! Often the service is terrible there; even with the laws in place. As has been said; it's a one off payment. Unless you have the time to trek around Doha looking for a commission free home;stick to the main agents(NOT THE INDIVIDUAL ONES!)and make them work!</RelCText>

So it is evident that they will not give me NOC and i will be banned for 2 yrs. My husband is working here in Qatar. But his salary is too low to apply for a family resident visa. I wish to know if I resign my job and once the company cancels my RP; can I come back to Qatar in family visit visa and extend it for another 5 months. So we hope by the time; we can make any arrangements for family resident visa. Please your reply is really valuable.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I am not too sure on all the formailities however; would suggest that you get in touch with your embassy. As far as I know; yor wife needs a RP (residence Permit) which can only be done once you have yours. If she come on the Visit visa; she will only be able to stay a few months and will have no rights (Hospital; Bank account finding a job etc). Not to say that she can not come on the Visit Visa but she would have to leave after the Visa expired and apply for a Residency under your name from her country unless she has her own sponslor in Qatar.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>You can sponsor your wife only when you have RP (residence permit) in hands.

			<RelCText>Chbck; your wife can come on a company business visa for 3 months renewable 3X. Once you get your RP; you can transfer her sponsorship under you; coz the company will give her No Objection Cert.; She doesn't need to exit and go back to her country. Once you applied for her the business visa; you just need to obtain a supporting affidavit from your embassy that you will shoulder all her expenses during the period. Trust me I did it for my cousin; though her sponsor was transfered to her company; and she got residence now. Good luck!</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Ok great; so let me make sure I understand what you are all saying. 1. My visa is good enough to get her in when she gets off the plane with nothing more than her passport. 2. She can get any other kind of visas that she needs to get once she's in the country and they won't make her go home. 3. If I leave for Doha on December 9th and she leaves for Doha on December 18th; we will be able to spend Christmas together. I understand that I should probably talk to my sponsor about all this too. thanks a million yall</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Waiiiit! Number 2. You have to apply the visa first from here (Doha) then send the visa no. to her so; she can print out from the net www.moi.gov.qa ;if she needs a copy. Visa application is just within 2 days(it depends). She just need her passport in the airport here coz her visa details is already in the computer network system in Immigration Doha Airport.

Assuming that you're already in Doha; and you want to bring your wife here very very soon; fortunately; u dont have RP yet. There is still a way for her to come but under any company business visa or a tourist visa (but 28 days only...also 3x renewable from travel agency); then transfered to your sponsor once you got ur RP. And she don't need to go back to her country. For the supporting affidavit; I think the best way is to get from her sponsoring company coz u dont have RP yet that time; right?

			<RelCText>yes they may deny you entry depending on your profession. i was rudely denied check-in by airport staff. they did not believe that i am allowed a visa upon arrival in dubai. had to buy last minute tickets from QA which costs a fortune. long story short- i was given visa upon arrival and i emailed the admin of flydubai about the incident. nothing happened to my compaint.. hope this helps</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Fly Dubai really sucks. Their airport staff seems to have no clue about Dubai immegration procedures and can easily ban any passenger from boarding. the airport counter has no supervisor to talk to; in case of any conflict and their main office staff are worse in cooperation. I had a similar situation where they did not allow me to board as my RP had only 2.5 months expiry date. I purchased a ticked on Qatar Airways and got an arrival visa at Dubai without any problem. Fly Dubai was not convinced and they seemed did not want to listen and escaped from paying back the ticket cost. I desided to use a good reputed carrier even with double or tripple ticket fare rather than facing such irresponsible situation at the last moment.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Thanks heaps for the replies.I feel that if our profession is allowed on arrival visa in Dubai; then rest depends on our ability to convince the airport staff in Doha!</RelCText>

Even though the water was too cold for swimming; the place is amazing. I can't wait to go there in summer... well.. let's say before the summer heat :-) Let's use this opportunity and suggest some nice beaches to go to. What is your favorite place? Peace!</RelQBody>

			<RelCText>If you are a Resident here in Qatar; you should see the Country. It's not big so you can cover it pretty easily. Get yourself a Map and also the Marhaba book; take your friends with you and drive; there are numerous nice beaches around in Qatar that are accessible with a normal Sedan. Sealine which is mentioned by others are maybe not the most impressive beach for some; but it is ok. It is not far away so go there first. Then on other weekends travel to Dukhan; Al Ruwais; Al Khor Etc; to see for yourself. You will not find any facilities at any of the beaches so keep that in mind.

			<RelCText>Go to Shamal; its superb. The park has basic facilities such as rest room; shades etc. You dnt need to swim; u can sit in one of those boats (free of charge :P) n chit chat in the cool breeze while the boat is floating to the light waves (dnt worry; its anchored n the water is only knee high). You can simply walk into the sea for around a km; its just knee depth for so long. Not too crowded like mesaeed n ofcourse no need to pay a cent unlike sealine n got plenty of space to sit; eat n hv a nap in the garden. Take ur food n water. If u take old khor road n follow ruwais/shamal directons given on roads; u'll reach shamal. Ask anyone there; where the park is n u r there. Enjoy ur time.</RelCText>

The same as the stay at home mom's; dad's seem some life outside of watching the kids or even just staying with the kids. PM me and I'll send you my hubby's #. I'm sure he'd be very happy to get together and chat. One thing I can say is kudos to the dad's; you guys do soooo much to take care of our families and sometimes we mom's get lost in our own worlds to realize it.

			<RelCText>There is a sleep clinic at the Hamad. It was there that I discovered that I had sleep apoenea; and they have treated that now. Its abslutely amazing to sleep all night every night; {except when I forget and have caffeine; or a fizzy drink by mistake) - first time in over 40 years! Go to the second floor (the one above ground floor)in the OutPatient Dept and ask at room 215 for the sleep clinic. They will direct you as to what you have to do to be assessed. You will need a Hamad Health Card (100 QR) for this. Angelwings.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I had to stay overnight at the Hamad Hosp; while a couple monitored me all night from another room. I was wired up all over the place; which for me wasn't too comfortable; and then left to 'sleep'... which I did very little of anyway as I didn't like the 'wiring'. I was also diagnosed by the Maxillo Facial Surgeon; who checked the size of my jaw; tongue etc etc; and noted that this was one of the causes of my apnoea. I didn't do the 'sleeping pills run' as I had an operation instead to alter my jaw and remove a bit of my tongue (sounds gross; but wasn't really that bad). But this is definitely the route to take; as pills may not be the answer for you... maybe there is something else wrong that can be corrected. Hope you get 'relief' soon...I know what you're going thru! Angelwings</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Dear Charlene; i have the same problem; for about 10 years. I saw a doctor here in Hamad Outpatients; his name is Abdoul Moneim; he is a very good psichiatrist; and he prescibed me the same sleeping pills i use to take in my country; that's Zolpidem (or Stillnox); its relly good; but he will not give you more than 14 tablets. When i canot get this medicine; i use to take Tryptozol 25 mg; but only half tablet; you can find it in any farmacy without prescription. I wish you good luck and sleep well..</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Hi Julia; Thanks for your reply. It is so good to hear that there is help out there! I guess I should of just went and asked a Dr. here instead of assuming that it would be like it was in Kuwait and couldn't get anything stronger then a Advil! Hope you are getting good rest now... bajesus; I'm afraid Panaodol night would never do the trick for me. As for the luttuce juice; well; I would rather stay awake! lol. Thanks though! e46m3 I can relate for sure. Nothing worse then trying to sleep and then just laying there tossing and turning. I've learned to just get up and stay up untill I feel like I'm going to drop; lol. A lot of nights I get out of bed and stay up the whole night without any sleep! Go to bed anywhere from 5:00 to 8:00 A.M and still only get a few hours sleep...Person can't function well to say to least. I've been up for two hours this morning and it is now only 6:00! And it is moving day..... Hope to hear you are getting some much needed rest! Thanks everyone; Charlene</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Have you made sure that you're cutting out all caffeine before sleeping? It takes 6 hours to flush out caffeine from the body; which is found in not only the obvious; like tea and coffee; but also in fizzy drinks like coke; seven-up etc; tonic water (very; very bad!!); soda water; beer; and sparkling wines and sparkling mineral water. Anything with bubbles can activate the brain instead of allowing it to sleep. Also; chocolate is a sleep depriver too. If you're taking any of the above within six hours of going to bed; then you'll have sleep problems if you react to them. Most folk don't think about the chocolate biscuit with a cuppa; late on in the day; but that's saying goodbye to sleep! regardless of what stress you are or aren't under. I stayed awake for four days once; when I was drinking just tonic water (I don't have a sweet tooth). A friend told me of his similar situation when he'd had a tonic water in a 'mixer' drink. He also took four days to figure out what was wrong...and e.....</RelCText>

On the other hand; your daughter is only three and from my experience (as a nursery teacher) at this age you should foucus on language development (not sure how many languages you teach to your child; but it gets more difficult if you are exponsing your child to two or three different languages); abc's and letter recognicion including reading small words and recongnising her own name in writting; counting and number recognition; colours;shapes arts and crafts and pencil control for tracing lines; numbers and letters.

			<RelCText>We will be moving to Doha in the early spring. I've homeschooled my children (now 10 and 12) their entire lives; so I've done pretty extensive research on homeschooling there. There is a Yahoo group for homeschoolers in Doha. http://groups.yahoo.com/group/DohaHomeEducators/ You could start with some basic info there. It's a pretty flexible group that meets whenever some member decides to set something up. Just about homeschooling in general: 3 is very young to begin formal schooling. I think I would focus on letting your child explore the world and reading lots of good books to her. But if you are determined; here's a good resource for younger kids: http://www.fiarhq.com/B4FIVEINAROW.html If you have any other questions; feel free to ask. Homeschooling has been a great experience for us. My husband's company has offered to pay for their tuition to a private school in Doha; but we are opting to continue homeschooling because it has been such a positive thing.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>these sites definitely reflect the lack of understanding of recruitment in people who designed them what they do is to match you on very limited criteria such as the last industry you worked in. What I mean is: if for example you've worked in Oil &amp; Gas for years; but your last job (even just 6 momths) was in pharmaceuticals; then they will match you with pharmaceuticals! Working in HR I look on CVs posted on Gulf Talent only in desperate times and to be honest never employed anyone through these web sites. So; if you're looking for a job; I would suggest uploading your CV on Gult Talent or Bayt just in case you get lucky; but spend most of your efforts applying directly through companies' web sites and going in to the companies to hand in your CV. Good luck!</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I use them a lot for a variety of uses as I live in Dukhan. 5 years ago if you called and asked for a taxi tomorrow they would say that nothing was available until 3am two weeks on Tuesday. Now they say yes no problem; call back to confirm the details; call the day before to remind me and call when he is on the way. I have never had a problem with the drivers except sometimes they are clearly under a lot of pressure and stressed. Maybe people could show some compassion for the drivers who live under difficult conditions so you get a cheap service. By the way I find the blatant racism on this website offensive. Most forums would not allow it. It is outrageous to define people by their nationality and such serious allegations; if not able to prove are simply slanderous.</RelCText>

I'm sure he'd be very happy to get together and chat. One thing I can say is kudos to the dad's; you guys do soooo much to take care of our families and sometimes we mom's get lost in our own worlds to realize it.

			<RelCText>the author of that article seemed to have no clue as to the country's appeal. First of all; he made it seem as the only arabic people interested in studying were Qataris and Egyptians (when 20% of the arab students here are from Kuwait; UAE and Saudi). He also tried to lightly mention a bit of disappointment about the fact that the 'mingling' period had no alcohol... (odd to mention it since I've never been to any educational event where there is alcohol in the UK or in Japan) He made it seem as nobody was interested in QU when the university is always full and it's a beautiful university at that. __________________________ Cost of Living; Visas; Safety Info; Tips; Pics; Vids and m</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"Tallg; When Booth killed Lincoln; he shouted "" Woe to the Traitors""; similar to what Brutus said when he killed Caesar. The Western media has an inherent bias; which is very subtle. Israeli forces are called: IDF ( Israeli Defense Forces) Whereas; a Palestinian child  throwing a rock at an Israeli tank passing through his family orchard is a ""Future terrorist"" I dont support either the soldier or the rock-thrower. However; I believe in calling a spade a spade. That's why a magazine like ""The Economist"" is respectable and a media source like ""Fox News"" or ""CNN"" is a farce to promote the bias inherent in their owners. The Internet; howvere; has changed all that by breaking the monopoly of content generation and content dissipation. :-) zaki the duckie"</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Tallg; I have had remarks like 'what have you cooked'  or stick to poetry; which were completely irrelavant to the topic so don't be disappointed. It is a healthy article for many. I wanted to add few excerpts from Dr. Tidu Maini; who is a adviser to 'Sheikha Mouza'. He says 'developing countries will fail if they do not invest in education and research and convert their economies into knowledge based ones'. So there is a lot of interest being generated into research and knowledge; particularly in energy; environment and healthcare.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>don't believe the stupid people who say it's ok to not pay the loan. the insurance does not cover termination. when you applied for a loan; there normally is a clause in your salary letter (depending on where you're employed) saying that it is your employer's responsibility to inform the bank that you are leaving their services and/or your final dues will be paid to your bank account with them. you may need a clearance letter from the bank before you are able to leave qatar permanently. you may be able to get away with a simple exit permit but you might become blacklisted and might never be given a visa to enter qatar or even the gcc again. also; they might have ways to find and go after you; you never know.</RelCText>

It is insurer of your loan who has to deposit your balance loan money .... they make huge profits ...only on few occasions they are paying it back ... that's why they cry. We are with you .... at this difficult time &amp; Wish you good luck ... Wed; 05.03.2014 ; 06.43 hrs ....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>my husband will be calling the PRO in the afternoon to check if he passed by the office and what did they say. Many Lebanese are getting the visa but sometimes it's taking like 3 months and some other times it is taking 9 months and if they are lucky it is taking them 2 weeks. Let's wait and see. however our expiry date is in april so I am hoping they will take this into consideration. I will keep you posted anyway. and you too update me if you got any news.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Souheir. I have been told that you have to go to Gharrafa and ask for Captain Nasser El Attiyah. you talk to someone over there or if you can to the Captain and tell him your case and he will directly sign your visa. as for me I will wait till the end of this week. but if you want you can go there and give it a try. you have to go between 6AM at 11 AM.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Do you mean that they will see if it's an urgent case they will accept ; and if not they will not ? I am wondering is it so easy to meet the captain !! I think I'll wait for your visit first as I don't have any good reason to give for this visa ... just I miss parent... may be it's not enough :-( Thank you and good luck ... hope you'll get the visa</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I'll try to answer your questions to the best of my abilities. My son is about to turn 8 months old so I had a lot of similar questions when I came out here three months ago. Toys 'r' Us has a small selection of baby items. That said; I was surprised to see some of the items that I found there (i.e. Bumbo seat) but they were more expensive than what I could pay back home. Brand varies depending on what kind of product you're looking for. Here's what I found: Baby items (nursing/feeding): Chicco; Avent; Munchkin; Gerber; etc. car seats/Strollers: MacLaren; Pliko; Chicco; Graco Jarred food: Gerber; limited selection of Heinz organic; hero Formula: Similac; Nan (by Nestle) Diapers: Pampers and Huggies and Luv??

And I can't imagine the Qatari government would entertain the thought of allowing a QDC-type monopoly to run sex shops around the country (imagine having to acquire a license for these shops. based on your marital status not your annual income of course :p)</RelCText>

			<RelCText>We take our son to a British nursery so I expect parents who drop off their kids there are Westernized (if they're not expats) and be safety conscious. Then one day; I saw an Arab father strapping his daughter into a BOUNCER that was on the floor of a minivan. I guess he figured that as long as his daughter is secured to something; then that's good enough! ------------- There's a wide variety of carseats here; mostly made by Western companies and the prices are comparable to what you'd pay. I know that Britax convertible car seats are highly rated but I don't think I saw any here. I also wonder; if the carseats weren't so expensive to the locals and other nationalities; will they be more wiling to secure their kids?</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Thank you for your comments.I am not suprised that there are no carseat laws.The car seats are for my two sister inlaws that live in Qatar. I am hoping that if I send the seats as gifts that they will use them. I am interested in the Britax brand because they will safely hold a child in a 5 point harness for up to 80 lbs. The seats are large and there is plenty of room so the children can use them comfortably for a long time.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Hi; I'm new to this forum. I feel very passionately about this topic. I have a 19 month old son and am very anal when it comes to car seats. Malaysia (where I come from) does not have car seat laws in place but I still make sure that my son travels in a car seat ; even if it's to the nearby shops. There are many available for purchase in Malaysia but the price is far too expensive for the majority. A decent car seat could set some back two months wages. So I guess even if they are aware of the need for child car seats it is out of their reach and I guess they have other prioritoes like buying food to stay alive and having a roof over thier head. Plus families in Malaysia can have as many as 4 (quite common) up to 14 children. Imagine the logistical nightmare of moving the family members around! . I've been staying and studying in Australia for the past ten years. When I got pregnant; I found out that hospital won't let you take your baby home unless you have a baby capsule.

			<RelCText>I have never understood the excuse that a person has too many children and cannot afford to put their safety first. I think it's great that people have so many children but please don't have so many if you their safety cannot be a priority. Did anyone hear about that study done in the States about the safety of carseats? ONLY 2 passed!!! That is just unbelievable to me. People have been thinking that their children are safe because the car seat has passed regulation laws. They obviously only passed at the minimum.</RelCText>

No contest. AD has much much much more social/night life; infrastructure is generations ahead; the roads in abu dhabi are second to none; traffic is well taken care of and life in general is much better. Women are way way way nicer and much more social as well. Build quality of the houses is far ahead of what is available in doha and the city is much cleaner; greener and about a million times better organized. As for roads; ill put it this way; i was at the officers club in Abu Dhabi late for my flight. So I told my taxi driver (mercedes e class wagon) to plz hurry to the airport. He was driving at 200-220kph only slowing down to 140kph for the cameras; and drove at that speed for a good 10 mins; and had me at my destination well before time. Roads in Abu dhabi are AMAZING.

			<RelCText>You obviously haven't lived in Abu Dhabi itself. Parking is chronic and parked vehicles often damaged. We did over two years there and there were times when we returned late and the nearest parking spot was almost a taxi ride away.

			<RelCText>There is land route via Saudi Arabia. You have to cross Qatar- Saudi border; then Saudi-UAE border. Both borders u will have to spend atleast one hour for clearance. Then you have to pay road insurance for both the countries(ie. Saudi and UAE). The road in between qatar- saudi border and saudi-UAE border is not that good. Extra care is required. UAE border post; you may have to scan your eye for entry visa purposes that can take sometime. Altogether you have to spend 6 to 7 hours..... enjoy your trip</RelCText>

I got an offer in a well reputed organization in Doha for 21;000. Is it worth the move? What concerns me the most is the cost of housing. How much would I pay for a descent 1 bedroom ?

			<RelCText>According to other guys who answered its abudabi; but according to me its Qatar since i have experienced it. Bocz its a small country; most important..less traffic comparetively ; accomadation more or less similar to badi; can get drivers license easily(comparetively); every thing like airport hospitals hyper markets etc are easy to access. Further more it depends on your priorities;like what kind of guy you are; how your life style etc....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Both offers are very good; but looking at the cities and living conditions i would have preferred Abudhabi over Qatar reasons are. 1. Abudhabhi is in UAE which is very big compared to Qatar and u can move to Sharjah; Dubai; ajman; fujairah and manymore places without visa; entertainment and social life is good in Abudhabhi; 2. Living standards are good in Aubdhabhi; 3. Rentwise both cities offer you houses at same prices. 4. Traffic congesetion is more in Doha compared to Abudhabhi; So i would have preferred Abudhabhi</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"Hmm.. but neither VISA nor Mastercard; nor my QNB debit cards worked. AFAIK; VISA and Master use different networks. I tried it in all ATMs; even Citibank (which usually works everywhere). And of course QNB denies everything. Only this particular bank in this particular country. Elsewhere; from Brazil to Switzerland no problems with QNB cards at all. Now the question is how we are supposed to ""check with our financial institution""? ;)"</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Must be the group or bank; who is or sponsoring the QNB card. Not necesserarily is your bank; is the institution where the alliance for the visa is coming from. It just pop in my mind; Maybe your bank just have the card block; and they need to lift it. That is just another option. One time in Kenya ; my bank block it; because they tought soemone stole it. Neverless to say their security measures are tedious and painfull; but is about customer protection. I did call them and they lift the ban right away. Cardinal OF QATAR LIVING</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Actually as for my case; since I have my valid license in my home; I am entitled for a half course or direct test.

			<RelCText>I also have driving licence(from home country) and go for short course but after having pre-test (which is not mandatory)they forced for full course and according to other student it is their practice especially for short course student and important is they never tells students about such so called pre-test at the time of admission after having few classes they inform you about pre-test which is unfair........ while with karawa after completed the classes you can go directly for test with police department(which is quite normal).</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Notice rodqie76; he mention that they forcibly or tactfully impose long/full course through so called pre test;and they refuse students to go for the test with traffic department; and after giving admission fee no one think to go any other institute. Why don't they allow direct test with traffic dept;Let them decide who can drive or not.don't pressurize for long course!! Make each and every thing clear at the time of admission.

			<RelCText>So we are at the same point that they are good for long course or full course but not having qualified instructor who can teach in certain time and therefore they enforce through pre-test to go for full course. In case any student wish to go for test then they refuse even they didn't allow to submit the exam fee of that student while other institute doesn't have such they follow the proper rule by traffic department;while they are having their own sub-rule. Point is if traffic department allows for short course or direct test why they take pre-test and enforce for full course. It is good only for those who are not sure either they can drive properly or not!!!not for all......... any way Congratulations you got your licence after having full course.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Good point razingbull.....but the question comes in mind about the credibility and quality of rest of the institute!!!!and in that case the leverage given by traffic department is just waste because they allow such students to go directly to the TEST..........not enforced pre-test.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"You are lucky Razingbull......if these are quality measures why they are hiding at the time of admission if someone insist to pay exam fee at the same time they said you will pay three days before exams.....why they are showing such double standards;if they are quality conscious then must inform to students ""if you pass pre-test then institute allows you to go for test if you agree then take admission"" other wise they are over ruling the permission given by government/traffic department which allows for direct test or short course."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>once when I was booking in with my female aunt!! I think it was because we did not have a male escort they were very being very difficult. It was not a hotel I would normally chosen to have stayed in; but there was a big conference on and I had to resort to this one. Turns out even my marriage certificate was not good enough as we got a knock on the door at 11.00pm and told to leave the hotel .. they said I did not have a ministry stamp on my marriage certificate; nor did I have a LETTER OF PERMISSION from my husband. I was so angry .... I got the man to ring my husband; but that wasn't good enough either .. this was when they said I needed the ministry's stamp on my marriage certificate!!!!!! Anyhows; my husband and I have regularly stayed in hotels in Doha. If you are going to stay in one of the 4 or 5 star ones they generally just ask you to produce your passports. I don't think they will let you book the one room knowing you are not married. If I was you; I would book in under your.....</RelCText>

The staff is diverse with a large number of employees from the UK. I think it should be a good experience.

			<RelCText>Hi Che and others; I'm also coming to Doha to work for Al Jazeera Insha Allah. Apart from waiting over 2 months now for my flight intinary since signing the contract (!) I also had the same concerns about the accomodation. Does anyone know if the accomodation that is given to employees is in a specific compound or area; or do they have a network of landlords on their books and choose that way; and does that mean the apartments could be anywhere in the capital? cheers and all the best</RelCText>

			<RelCText>aljazeera is an equal opportunity company so your nationality should not matter; I also got a job offer there and am still waiting to finalize things. I already visited the company and I was thrilled with the place and the employees; they are extremely nice and helpful which you don't really find in much TV stations so it is a blessing. As per your concern about accomodation; from what I heard is that all employees who are married and have children are provided with a very decent villa in a compound and single employees are provided with a 3 bdrm furnished apartment in a nice place as well. After all aljazeera has a big name and I dont think they will throw their employees(their best resources) in a place that is unfit or unsafe. Good luck and I hope to see you there.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>It takes time to apply for a work visa. Another thing it will take also some time to process your papers there in P.I. They booked you a return ticket because you will not be allowed by P.I. immigration to board with only one way ticket. You're on a business visa and you need to come back to where you came from. That is only for formality sake so you can passed thru Immigration. Better have your medical check up there before coming here. Like chest x-ray and blood stool urine lab test. If you fail here you will be sent back.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>this is a very normal thing.. once you got here your business visa should be converted to working visa. The problem arises in the Immigration in Philippines. They will ask lots of questions and squeeze in some out of nowhere questions.. Just be prepared and act one that knows the Law.If you fail to pass thru the immigration; they will definitely get the last penny you have in you pocket. I felt bad to some people who are a victim of this. There was already a report in yahoo maktob stating how cruel the immigration officers in asking for some money for the individual to get out of the country! Aren't they supposed to let that person pass peacefully? I hate to say this but ; my tax when I was still working in Manila;paid them well enough... so they should serve us well and with respect instead of bullying us for the sake of money! :D Just my 2 cents here!</RelCText>

			<RelCText>luke_137; 1) You know why does this issue exist? There is a heavy abuse of the Business visa concept. Filipinos find their ways to buy this type of visa for the purpose of coming to Qatar and searching a job here. Which is illegal. Your immigration fellows only use your own criminal approach to this matter. One part of the mafia is buying the illegal visas. Another part of the mafia wants to have their fat piece out of it. Simple. YOUR own criminal action leads to your immigration officers’ criminal actions. YOU ALL are involved in this vicious circle; as one criminal group. STOP buying the illegal visas; and this will cut the ground from under the feets of your fellow-immigration officers; and they will stop demanding thier share. Sunny ; as an exception; it does not apply to you. Unlike others; you got your business visa legally; issued by your hiring Company. Other hundreds and hundreds of your fellow filipinos abuse this law. And then they complain that other law abusers want to .....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>lymisaj; you are giving false information to public; as others mentioned there is no Free visa; there are some people selling few visas by their influence with Sponsor and allowing him to work outside (illegally) and none of the company will appoint you unless you have proper visa; once you got a personal sponsored visa you cant change your visa for another 5 years and within this time you are working here illegally and if they catch you you will be in jail and will be deported. If your visa is under any company you can chage after 2 years. Always good way; apply for jobs in Qatar with your qualification; now a days most of the companies are getting business visa under their company and later you can change to work visit. Some times Free visa holders stuck in this country and you may never meet your sponsor after you arrive in this country and may not get Exit permit to go for vacation or Emergency situation.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>i dont think there is a problem nowadays with visa. Most of the reputed companies (banks; oil companies) get them easily. But if u happen to know that there is a problem to this particular bank; then its possible to get back that indian visa u are talkin about. usually; the government issues certain number of visas to establishments. If they bring someone and finds that he is not good or he misbehaves with the officers; then they have the right to kick him out of country; in that case the company gets back that visa and can bring new staff from india...</RelCText>

I tried to change my profession from Technician to Manager through our agent but for some reason he is saying it is not possible. I have Masters in Business administration and Masters in Geology. I really wonder why this change can't be done. Does any body has any suggestion of how to do this change?</RelQBody>

			<RelCText>So you will be on a business visa until your RP comes through all you have to do is tell your company when you are going and they will apply for a exit visa which is just a piece of paper really saying you are allowed to go and they will also get you the entrance visa for when you come back! You can go wher you like just remember to check if you need a visa for the other countries you wish to visit! Also make sure they have done your business visa before you fly out so it is sorted for when you land!</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"Hi Alex; You'll find the gay scene here a little odd. It's not acceptable and actually illegal to be gay here. If you are caught you will possibly be lashed and deported. That being said there are many MANY MANY gay men here. There is quite a thriving underground gay scene. No specific bars; but if you hang out at the Pearl; Admirals or Cloud Nyn; you defintely run into a few. Now; from what I understand there is a lot of ""boy-toy"" ""sugar-daddy"" action here. The Arab men aren't really comfortable with having a relationship; so they tend to stick to just sex. If you want lots of stuff like cars and apartments; there the guys you go too. If you want a relationship; unfortunatly; you might be out of luck. There are some really great gay guys here; and most of them want relationships; but they say it's just really hard to maintain one here (not surprising because heterosexual relationships are hard to maintain here too). It's just the lifestyle I guess. You're probably going to get a lot o....."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Heay; What a coincidence! I just finished my studies in Australia and going back home (Al Khor community) next month :). Al Khor is a great place to live; I've been livin there since 1998. We've got several club houses with heaps of facilities like gym; swimming pool; basketball &amp; tennis court.. and much more. The community also has its own supermarket; hospital (it's huge!!); nurseries...etc. I've met a few Aussie teachers there in Al Khor International school (also inside the compound). In the weekends people usually go to Doha city.. which takes only 25-30 minutes by car. The community also provides shuttle buses inside the compound; and shopping buses that takes you to different places/stops in Doha city. Hope this helps :)</RelCText>

			<RelCText>don't believe the stupid people who say it's ok to not pay the loan. the insurance does not cover termination. when you applied for a loan; there normally is a clause in your salary letter (depending on where you're employed) saying that it is your employer's responsibility to inform the bank that you are leaving their services and/or your final dues will be paid to your bank account with them. you may need a clearance letter from the bank before you are able to leave qatar permanently. you may be able to get away with a simple exit permit but you might become blacklisted and might never be given a visa to enter qatar or even the gcc again. also; they might have ways to find and go after you; you never know.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Matt; I've been here pretty much since 2008; and overall the place has improved since then. Certain laws and regulations change; and it can be a frustrating place; but on the whole you can live a very nice life here. I moved from London; and adjusted pretty easily. Come with an open mind and you'll be fine. There are plenty of people in the same position and you'll meet other expats easily. What I will say; is you have to build your life here and it can be an easy place to hate if you don't make the effort....especially for the wife. Hopefully she's outgoing; and it shouldn't be a problem to meet people. Choosing where to live is a big part! Maersk is in West Bay so possibly get an amazing apartment here close to all the bars and restaurants and City Center for shopping. Better for the wife if she can walk to places....Get somewhere short term in West Bay to start and give yourself a chance to learn about Doha and where you want to be permanently located. Longer message than planned!! .....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Hi All. I used Mr. Kabeer for my recent move within Doha. His price was very reasonable; a third of the price of the major moving companies. They packed everything up for me. I had to organise my own boxes which I did from QMart at the Mall; and they put all my stuff into them for me. They were quite careful with my stuff and no serious damage was incurred; but I had to supervise that they packed the fragile items carefully; and instruct them on what to put in each box. I strongly recommend him; but as with any move; supervise that the valuables and fragiles items are packed carefully or even better; by yourself. Also; be on hand to manage the packing.</RelCText>

When I tried to ring him to find out where he was; he didn't answer - I called four times. Then today he rang and said he was outside my place - apart from the fact that I'm working today and he's 24 hours late.... Hardly reliable; so just as well I'm not taking him On the upside; I tried Runway International.

			<RelCText>Both KLM and Lufthanza allow you to bring pets from the UK (via Netherlands or Germany) in the cabin. The pet plus the carrier has to weigh under around 8kg (which should be fine for a small breed). Price is surprisingly minimal - it is a fixed excess baggage charge of around £70 (check with airlines). The pet has to be transported in a carrier which fits under the seat (really only during take off and touch down). There are special soft carriers which have a tent-like squashable roof which will fit under the seat and spring back up. The brand that springs to mind is Sturdibag. Good luck! Btw I was told about the airlines by Doha Vets (who were amazingly helpful) and then checked directly with the airlines in the UK; who agreed with this...</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Thank you so much for this information Tiddsmum. Have you had experience of animals travelling this way yourself? I had checked with KLM who said exactly as you have; however when 2 companies in the U.K told me this was not allowed it left me feeling very deflated and wondering if it was maybe Doha Airport that dont accept dogs travelling this way. She is our daughters dog but is a very special part of the family and keeping our teenager onside for this move is very important. I really appreciate your replying as I have tried to obtaining this through other blogs; websites to no evail; all say cargo; excess baggage in hold. I will also contact Doha Vets who may be able to help with import certificate and help upon our arrival.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Get in touch with Dr Khaled El Hossan (khaled@dohavets.com); he can sort all the paperwork out this end. The import licence is valid for 1 month; but it may be worth finding out how long it takes to get one in the first place... All you will need to do is sort out the export papers from DEFRA at UK end - this is the link to the relevant contacts: http://animalhealth.defra.gov.uk/about/contact-us/tradeexports.html Oh; here is an example of the type of carrier: http://www.zooplus.co.uk/ask?q=sturdi+bag&amp;num=20&amp;form=search&amp;gclid=CMbG7c2d468CFQt66wodhz7NwA This is all theory - I had been planning to bring out my elderly cat (who would have been too stressed in the hold); but as we are not staying in Qatar; will now not need to do this.

			<RelCText>they will accommodate that`s no problem. I have a dog as well but you will not be able to let him run free in parks cause it`s not allowed. But if you will go somewhere far to a beach outside doha it wont be a problem and you can take him with you along the sea side but not free. They don`t have the same mentality like us and some of them are not allowed to touch them because of their religion but it`s ok they will just ignore you. Nobody will bother you as long as you keep it close to you. In the end of the day is better for the dog to be with you cause he is part of the family already so even if will be different for him here at least he will be with you. Cheers</RelCText>

			<RelCText>The villa's don't tend to have very big gardens; more of a yard. But on the plus side; you can take them to the coast or desert 10 mins outside doha and run them off lead. Like Cristian said; most other nationalities aren't too keen on dogs; especially if they're not viasably restrained. One thing I would advise; is to maybe to come out for a few months without your dog and make sure that the job and lifestyle are right for you; because once you've got your dog here; getting him back into the UK is a pain ( 6 months quarenteen) as qatar isn't on the pet passport scheme unfortunately - there is talk; but it may be a long way off!!

			<RelCText>Thanks Dem; Is that a pic of your dog? I have quite a large dog; so he def needs to run and if we can drive to these beaches that'd be great. Yes that is such a pain re brining him back and the quarantine; but we don't have anyone we can leave him with for so long here in the UK - which again is a pain. So; if we walk him anywhere else in Dpha he needs to be on the lead? In terms of the villas etc; I am guessing he will be inside most of the time; becuaee of the heat.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"I have a largish dog (25 kilos) - we go to the beach (early in the morning to avoid inconveniencing those who are not keen on dogs) and she runs off lead. However; she is good at coming when she is called - if your dog is not; start working on that now. There are usually large open (vacant lots) that you can also allow your dog to run off lead; IF there is no one else around. Contrary to popular belief; dogs are not haram (forbidden); but there are certain steps a muslim must take after touching a dog or if a dog touches something a person uses. You can read up on it online. There was an article today in the Peninsula newspaper about how animals are supposed to be treated in Islam. Basically; just treat everyone you meet (until you know better) as someone who is uncomfortable/afraid of dogs. IMHO it's common courtesy to give way to the people; Hey I love my dog but I won't let her run ""wild"". I wish more people with kids felt the same way LOL Signature line > ""You can't fix stupid"""</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Thanks marycatherine; Is there only one or two beaches where they can run? He is very good and will come back to me so no probs. He is slightly bigger at 45 kgs...but he is my baby! Also what are the vacant lots? Are these just contained areas where this is nothing? Are there any groups that meet with dogs? It'd be great to meet some other dog lovers as well; and let him socialise. I would always be careful of others feelings towards dogs; as I know not everyone will love him.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>There are a lot of people here in qatar with dogs; and you sound like you've got him under control; so thats fine. You're bound to find people with dogs to socialise with.

			<RelCText>"With villas; it really depends on the landlord I guess. I live in a small compound with my wife and two dogs (one's pretty large at 42kg and the other is a 3 month puppy) and our neighbors also have a dog. We usually take them out on walks behind the compound where there's a big empty lot. However; you can't really walk your dogs everywhere (ie Corniche). There's a beach in an area called Al Wakra (which is about a 10-15min drive from Doha) where my wife and I usually take our two dogs out for a run and swim on Friday mornings with another friend who also has a dog. You'll see quite a few dog owners out there on the beach with their pets and as long as your dog is well behaved it's all good. It's a pretty big public beach and not crowded at all so you're bound to find a huge ""vacant lot"" where you can do your own thing and not bother anyone."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Hello All; I used Runway International in Doha when I was moving back to UK from Doha. They came and packed my items at home. We left to UK and later we were shocked to know that this guy from Runway International demanding more money else he said he is not going to ship my consignment. I had no other alternative but to transfer money. He said my shipment will reach me in 45-60 days but in reality it reached us in 98 days. Once we received our items we were shocked to see that the boxes were tampered; opened and repacked. We realize that our items have been stolen.

			<RelCText>Hello All; I used Runway International in Doha when I was moving back to UK from Doha. They came and packed my items at home. We left to UK and later we were shocked to know that this guy from Runway International demanding more money else he said he is not going to ship my consignment. I had no other alternative but to transfer money. He said my shipment will reach me in 45-60 days but in reality it reached us in 98 days. Once we received our items we were shocked to see that the boxes were tampered; opened and repacked. We realize that our items have been stolen.

			<RelQBody>Hi Can anyone tell me what the procedure is when first coming over to Qatar; are you given a little time to sort out your home and transport before attending work and when do companies tend to give you your furniture allowance. How do workers from blighty generally get paid into UK or Qatar banks? Who are the best internet and satalite providers? Whats the weather like!!! lol</RelQBody>

			<RelCText>depend who you working for. I am sure every company have their own way doing things. For us ... we were given a company housing for the first 3 months ; then they give you allowance to look somewhere else. We receive our furniture allowance as soon as my husband pass his probation period. The first 2 weeks husband get a car and a driver to go to work; after that we rent a car till we received our resident permit and able to buy a car. Internet so far only 1 provider : Qtel.So take it or leave it... you dont have a choice. The pay tranferred to our local bank; then every few months we send the money to the UK. Anyway ... welcome to QL; do use the 'search' button on the top right to search any question you have in mind.

			<RelCText>First of all;find out the exact reasons for this behaviour.Try to find out his likes and dislikes.His areas of interest. Once this is done;see if Qatar can match his life style.Please donot make any false promises(even unknowingly) because this can worsen the situation. As soon as you reach here;make it an exciting experience for him.May be taking hium around to places he would like to visit or things he would like to do will help.

			<RelCText>My mom's friends have kids between the ages of 14-16. Their parents don't let them do much because they can't really do anything here aside from school; mall; and swimming parties in compounds. And from coping with the behavior? Not moving to Qatar will help. He's in his teen years and he's probably into doing senseless things (like when we were at that period in our lives); so.. you might want to have a second thought. But then again; he's a guy.. so; it's much better than having to drag a teen daughter to the middle east.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Totally depends on your budget! Salwa Road (You can find some luxury designer brands and bathroom/kitchen fittings.) Home Center in City Center; Centerpoint/Al Asmakh Mall; and Musheireb. Homes R Us in Hyatt Plaza. Bo Concept in City Center. Souq Al Haraj in Najma area. ID Design in The Mall. Origins (www . originssofas . com) I usually end up buying from Home Center because it's relatively inexpensive; and at times I take things apart and customize them. Some of the couches in ID Design are very cute; colorful; modern and at a decent price if you are looking for something nicer than Home Center. But Doha still lacks a great basics store for furniture. That's why everyone is waiting on Ikea.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>That's the problem with furniture in Doha. Look at Bombay Company in the Mall and their US website and compare the prices. We wanted a bed that cost 17;000 riyals in their shop here and on the US website $1000; exact same bed. The silly (Lebanese) manager at the Mall shop said no discount; only for repeat customers! They wanted to maintain exclusivity. I think he meant the exclusivity of fleecing gullible customers or the exclusion of reason. One of the two. Even if I were to ship it from the US it would be cheaper buying it from the website.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>jarreau; the best way for you to learn how to wear the shayla (head covering) is to have an arab/qatari friend teach you...because if you observe the women in Doha you'll see that there are many styles and trends appropriate for certain ages; etc. :) i find it intimidating to go shopping for abayas because i don't wear them; and have no idea how to pick a good one out; even though i'm muslim. but if you're willing to try it; then i'm sure nobody would say it's wrong for you to wear one! these things are a very cultural matter rather than religious. so there is probably no 'danger' in offending anyone. :D</RelCText>

			<RelCText>It will be your first option as people will recommended. but that mall have a big problem of parking space. Villagio I really like it; but sometimes is very unconfortable as city center because too much people go at the same time. My favorite one was Land Mark. and I believe still my favorite. but I will go more to Villagio and Landmark than City Center. The only good thing for me from city center its the cinema.  The Venezuelan Sensation!!!</RelCText>

I'd like to get 'proper' ones; with hooks at the top and a pulley on the side; but so far all we've seen is guys who want to prey on expats or that service Qataris; to whom money is no object.

			<RelCText>Hi there! Personally I would not bring furniture when it comes to a fully furnished apartment in Doha ; as they do have the basic stuff being put in already;such as tv; tv cabinet; wardrobe; sofa bed . Like me; I will be very soon moving to one of the fully furnished apartment as well; n now have the difficulties getting rid of my bed; sofa; tv n cabinets - omg it sure will gonna take some time y'know; so judging from my own experience; I would not recommend you to bring too many of your own furniture :) Oh and welcome to Doha! :)</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Yes there is and it tends to be cheaper if u choose this option; but then again it also means they might not provide too many furnitures to you. I think it varies too when it comes to different property companies providing just what sort of furnitures; so it's important to find out from each of them if you do wanna go for a semi furnished one :)</RelCText>

			<RelCText>At this point you only have a temporary contract. You must past the medical exam which takes about a month to get your results. Meanwhile; you won't be issued a Qatar ID until you get your medical results and sign your permanent contract. Without a Qatar ID you won't be able to rent an apartment. Majority of the buildings have electrical and plumbing problems due to the unskilled foreign laborer's. Therefore; rent a fully furnished all-inclusive or company housing till you feel you might stay over a year.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I agree. Do not bring your furniture because most apartments around Doha are fully furnish.I notice the difference between fully &amp; semi is only 2k Qatari Riyals. I made a mistake bring my own furniture as I was recommended to bring.But the shipment container was paid for so I don't mind. So now i just mix my one set furniture which consist of 3 seater; 2 seater &amp; one seater;carpet &amp; one table with the apartment's furniture. Furniture at home centre are not that expensive IMO. if you do find a apartment or villa semi furnished.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Hey fitri; We moved here Oct 2004 from Dallas and it took roughly 60 days for our furniture and household goods to arrive. I'm not sure about your second question. As far as I know the shipment made its way to us shortly after it arrived and had cleared customs; so we never stored it. I suppose it would have been nice to send it 2 months in advance of our arrival though.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I believe that the shipping company in the states coordinated with one of the local moving companies and handled most of the paperwork. When our shipment arrived we simply had to find the moving company here and give them a map on where to deliver the goods. There may have been other steps handled by my wife or her company; but it seemed fairly straightforward. Your employer and/or moving company should give adequate instructions. Be aware that they may quarantine and return later anything that they think needs to be reviewed for content; like DVD's; VHS tapes; books; CDs etc. It seems our labeling of boxes helped them in this effort and so some of our DVDs that were in the labeled boxes arrived after quarantine while others that were just haphazardly packed were delivered on the first shipment. http://www.xanga.com/BBetz</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Hi Fitri. i am from India and have come in to Doha 8 days back. The delay in the process is only at the level of the directore I'm told. Apparently once the goods arrive in Doha; the local agent contacts customs and sets a date with them to inspect the goods. This takes up to a week. after customs goes through ALL items; they give their estimate and clearance. There is a tax of 5% on the goods being brought in levied. However household goods are exempted from the tax and the agent applied to the directorate for exeption. This is where takes time and I'm told can take upto 20 / 25 days to gte the clearance. Thus the option seems to be to either pay 5% of the valuation they have done or wait.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Ask any pathan (Pakistani nationals identified by their unique national dress) that you come across. Chances are good he himself might be an owner of a pickup. If not he would definitely arrange one for you. Or if you could drive down to Alfardan bus stand; you can find such big pickups parked in line with pathans sitting in the driving seats. The rate will obviously depend on from where you have to pickup your furniture and where to drop; but it should be within or around QR100. Bargaining will possibly bring down what you end up paying. One word of caution! Used furnitures are the primary source of blood sucker bed bugs.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Most decent towers will have a pool as well as possibly a tennis court. Or you could join one of the nearby hotel clubs. The villa compound life is more suited towards families. Think suburbia vs. city life. It can easily take 45 minutes to get from Villagio to West Bay. Traffic is the #1 headache in Doha.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Dear QLER Friend; Once you get the job offer from the company; the employer will also give you the letter issued to do the following (1) letter addressed to Medical commission for Medical (2) Letter addressed to CID Office; for CID clearance. If you have the letter; you have to take this along with your passport copy; original ID as well as a photocopy; with photos; go to CID office in Azizya; hope you know the location - if not - here is (direction - from Decoration R/A go to third r/a and turn right and first right; on your left you will see the office; go to building No.1 or 2 not sure; please get it confirmed) they will take your finger prints and the documents; you have to pay a fee through your card; no cash is accepted. You will be asked to come after two weeks or 20 days. You can collect the clearance certificate by showing your ID card. Hope this information is helpful to you. regards;</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Dear Maji08; They did not ask you because being a resident of Qatar; you must have already done your finger print for your RP; which is saved in their comuter records. When you apply for CID clearance for a job offer; they will check on the computer your finger prints; which they will use it to process your certificate. This was done in my case both in medical and CID clearance obtained for a job offer. Hope it is clear now.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Maji08; I think there is only one building for Application submission i.e Building No 2 where in you will take your papers( NOC from your present company; Letter subjected to CID from your new Employer; Passport Copy;2pp pics; PCC from your home Country(Embassy) attested with MOFA; Degree certificate) they will verify it and tell you if they need any thing more; if every thing is ok they will tell you to go to Finger printing section (building NO 11/12) and ask you to come back after you finish Finger Print scanning; then you will pay QAR 10 from ur Card ;then they will give you acknowlegment receipt and will tell you to come back after 10days Which is very early I believe.... This is the process for change of Sponsorship... what about you; can you explain me; are you working in any place or you under father/husband sponsorship; is the procedure different for it I dont know....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>It's depend on the job grade; usually they offered cheap package as compare with other industries or companies in Qatar. They offered me for Technical operation staff.. but people in QL advised me its a very less package to service in Qatar. Keep all the things in mind and than accept the offer bcz accommodation is the biggest problem in Qatar. But there is no harm to attend the interview; it will be a short trip for you. They will call you for interview in Doha; will take care of your food + hotel + air tickets etc. Enjoy your trip and Best of luck!!</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Technical Staff (Engineer &amp; Mech only (support staff not included)) basic salary has recently been revised and additionally; accommodation allowance is under review and expected to be revised by the end of month. Package offered to you would be based on EN02 grade which is among the best in middleast; anybody who says otherwise is not fully aware of ENG package (Support staff package is crappy). Slight variation would be based on your approvals; more you have more you earn. You will make good money on side because of overtime. Beast666</RelCText>

			<RelCText>hi there! don't expect too much.  your package includes basic; tranport allow HRA etc depending on what grade are you and 10% increment of basic salary every year depending on your boss' evaluations. Those allowances which you asked as far as I know are not  provided except OT during holidays no bonuses no incentives. You could only enjoy the unlimited ID90 SL booking hmmm  and very annoying in the airport. One confirmed annual ticket for your wife and yourself. Send me PM  I will give you more details.

			<RelCText>"just for everyone's info. the said annual ticket on each qatar airways staff is governed by their staff handbook. and it is always ""Subject to Load"" and not ""Confirmed"" so even you are on your annual leave you have to always wait at the staff check-in counter if there will be seats available. - live your life as simple as you are - money doesn't create man; but it is the man who created money - don't do what others say; just listen to them; but do what you feel good"</RelCText>

			<RelCText>i think it will not be the same. there should be adifferent fee for each rating. if i'm not mistaken that's how it goes with most of the airlines. if you ask me; there's no need to bring your tools. most of the work are done by mechanics anyway :-)     goodluck!</RelCText>

			<RelCText>It's a really crappy company; divided and having problems with their staff; and they treat the stewardesses really bad. Latest news is that a memo was circulated last week that bans the stewardesses for doing anything than staying at home when on standby; and that they need to get 12 hours of rest before each flight. This leaves them without a social life. The administration and and management treat everyone like garbage - in Europe this would be impossible but here its the way it is; they can always get some more Indians or Easter European. In the lastest 6 months 25 - 33 % of the staff has resigned or been fired so they always need new people. Salary wise it's ok - staff wise it sucks big time - I took the blue pill and found myself alive in Qatar - wish I had taken the red and stayed in Europe</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Cactiflora i think ur better off working for Malaysia Airlines. I hear there's no job stability with QA; and thats something u dont want to be worrying about all the time. I dont understand they say that if you make one mistake your more then likly to be sacked; and i travelled by QA once and their services were totally F*ckall!! First of all they were supposed to do a hotel booking on my return ticket which wasnt even confirmed till the time i was at the airport waiting for someone to pick me up from the hotel. Secondly the hotel that they did put us up in was in some freaking god forsaken sh*t hole in Mumbai; that even the taxi drivers didnt know where it was. I mean the staff at the QA are totally useless since they fill them with all inexperienced FEMALES just coz of their good looks.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Above is correct QDC is the only alcohol store in Qatar and you will be about 10 mins max from it. The compound is great; its quiet loads of kids about if you have kids good for them. It also has a shop very handy. And i think they have started doing shisha and coffee in the clubhouse. Plus loads of nice people inc many of my collegues; your lucky to get it.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Tipping does not appear to be customary among the local population. The people who perfom the tasks you have listed typically make between 600 and 1000 riyals per month; when that's the going rate for labor; one might surmise that Qatar is not home to a culture of conspicuous generosity. I suggest that you go with your conscience; bearing in mind that anything you give will probably be put to good use. With the exception of the car washers; none of these people have any control whatsoever over the prices of the services that they perform. What they can control is the service itself; and I generally use that as the basis for my own calculations.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>For the car wash; since it's usually 8 QR; I tip 2 QR For restaurants; I check to see if the tip has already been included in the bill. If it hasn't and the service has been good; I tip about 15 - 20 % of the total. BTW; hotels and some restaurants usually add a surcharge that is NOT the tip so check your bill - you might think tip is included when it's really not. For the gas attendants; I normally give about 3 QR when I fill up the car (it costs me about 30 QR to fill up). For the tea boy; I'm assuming the company compensates the person adequately - I haven't been here long enough but I would leave a tip at Christmas and special holidays; something like 100 QR - this also goes for the security guys at my compound. If someone pushed my cart and loaded the groceries into the car; I'd tip about 5 QR (if someone has to push my cart; it means I must have a ton of groceries). I haven't tipped the person who bags the groceries since I'm unsure about this one. I don't know the salaries of th.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>These guys don't get paid all that well really. I keep talking to office boys; cleaners and my houseboy quite often. Some of these are paid as low as Qrs. 450 per month. Infact; I know of our ex-office/tea boys; their company failed to renew the contract and they were jobless for couple of months. It isn't their responsibility to renew the contract obviously; but the sponsor penalised them by paying just Qrs. 100 per month until they could find another contract elsewhere! I think we are all lucky and should be thankful that we're paid really well when compared to these guys. I know few would argue that we are educated and we deserve to be where we are. But little generosity won't affect us much. 1. The guy that pushes the shopping trolley for you A: I PUSH MY OWN TROLLEY; IF SOMEONE DOES HELP ME I PAY QR. 2/- PER TROLLEY. 2.

			<RelCText>I usually judge of the quality of service recieved. Unlike many place except in Doha people don't tip as often as they should. Now probably back home when you got out and do the shopping someone bags your shopping with a smile (and not a grumble) walks you to your car with a smile (and not a grumble)then you tip them well. Personally... if they just to do it for the sake of getting a tip off an expat and you hand them over 2 riyals you'll still see tham standing there waiting for more?!</RelCText>

These women who works in the salon works from 8:30AM to 11:00PM; no overtime pay; salary is about 1000-1500 a month and some of them only have HALF DAY offs.

			<RelQBody>How much is deemed acceptable to tip a taxi driver? I was told by a couple of people who ave lived here for years that you dont tip them but i feel that as they are really helpful with assisting me and my kids in and out of the taxi; they deserve a tip. Also what do people do when a taxi driver doesnt turn on the meter on a very short trip and at the end of the trip; says pay as you wish? How am i to know what to pay him if i havent taken that route before? Any advice?</RelQBody>

			<RelCText>My criteria in tipping the taxi driver are: 1- Don't ask me no questions about me or don't tell me where you from. I got my Confession Booth for those moments. 2- Don't drive like you are driving Miss Daisy or some Indianapolis 500 racing stock car in the roads. Better use those turn signals and do your yielding. I have enough of the local population egocentric driving habits. 3- Don't be smelling like Garlic or some lost flowering fragrance; it just gives me a headache. I Don't want memories of the local malls. 4- Better have the meter on and pronounce those numbers properly. 5- and learn to difference between; drive Straight ahead; turn left and turn right.

			<RelCText>I think it's very rare for the service charge included in the bill to go to the waiters. I don't even know if 'service' actual means the waiter service. Best to ask the waiter if they get it or not. If they don't then leave a tip if you think they deserve it; for the amount you think they deserve. I hate the American culture of always tipping. A normal tip should reward normal service; with a bigger tip rewarding service above your expectations. But if the service is poor (as it so often is here) then they haven't earnt a tip in my opinion.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Please note that for every 10 person you will serve on the bar there are only 2 possible person that can give you a tip personally. Here in Qatar tips are not usually considered unless by the white peoples. But you need also to consider the company policy on tipping; for there are some which is centralized. But if you're expecting to received 100 riyals tip per day; I can say there's a big possibilities that you might not get it; besides; for sure you're not just the only one who's working there as a waiter.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Thanks aak. My flight has booked by the company that I will be working for. So hopefully I just have to turn up. (Famous last words!) I will finally be arriving in Doha on Saturday morning. What about tipping in Doha?? Is it usual practice to tip taxi drivers in Doha? What about tipping in general; who to tip and how much? This is my first time in Doha and the Middle East so don't want to make any mistakes or offend/upset people. Thanks again for any advice.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"Welcome to doha; may your stay yield fruitfulness and prospects in your career. I believe your company men will arrive at the airport to pick you up. call Taxis are identified as ""KARWA"" in here. There's no regular practice in tipping for taxis in doha Qr.2+ will do; however if you dont prefer there's no harm. People who deserve tips 1. Runners(who serve you parcels while you are on car) for small restaurants. 2. Petrol fillers. 3. Private car cleaners 4. The lists are endless; you will identify once you arrive in here... 5. road side guys selling news papers on hot weather. best of luck."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>You can most certainly use your cash card; providing it's hooked up to a world ATM network (Cirrus; etc.) or has a credit card symbol. I was not charged a fee by QNB (Qatar National Bank); only by my home bank (which I fully expected). As for an ATM in arrivals; unfortunately; I've not seen one. I may have missed it; though; as I've been wisked through by the greeting service both times. If you are going to a hotel first; you can either use an ATM or take cash and exchange it. I did this (exchanged cash) the first time at the Intercon(tinental) without difficulty. Just ask when you check in. If you are going to your accommodation; malls and shops are open late now with it being Ramandan (1 am or so). Ask your driver for advice. City Center Doha (the big mall); which I live across from; is like this. 10 minutes and the money problem is solved. Established shops will take a credit card should you need to make a purchase before you can get to the ATM. However; Doha is pretty wired. You ca.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Thanks for your comments and advice. The company have arranged limo to collect me and my son from the airport and to take us to the hotel. I was not sure if I would need to tip the driver or not. I think that I will just use my card to withdraw cash from my UK bank account when I first get to Doha so that I have some cash to use for small purchases and I will pay for larger purchases with my card. Thanks again for your help.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Mmm... well; I can see your point there. However; as you're just arriving in the country; no one is expecting you to have riyals ready to distribute. Or I'd hope not. Besides; the ATM spits out bigger bills than you'd tip to a driver (as in every country; UK included). So then you'd have the trouble of having to get one broken down. If you're going to the hotel; and you really want to tip the driver; just ask him to wait for a second. Run in; tell them what you want to do; and change a bill. Or borrow 10 riyals from the bellhop; tell them you're changing money in just a second; and then give it back after you've changed money. Truthfully; though; I wouldn't sweat it too much. You'll have other things to occupy yourself with. Which hotel? The Intercon is quite nice. The breakfast buffet is gigantic. Literally 15 kinds of bread (at least). Fresh fruit juices. A whole long table filled with fruit and cheeses.</RelCText>

Then I've gone straight out of the airport; to the car. I was thinking of the arrivals area BEFORE you go through the x-ray for appearances' sake process; as that's what I've seen. Cheers for confirming that I haven't gone completely nutter; just haven't seen the public area of arrivals yet. (^^)."</RelCText>

			<RelQBody>Is Qatar out of Coins? I have noticed that many businesses here in Qatar instead of giving the proper change back on a purchase; they try to give a candy or some gum. And the prices are always conveniently priced at a little over .50. The clerk always says sorry Sr. We have no change or the boss tells us to give the gum. It’s a great way for them to earn extra. When they offer me the gum I tell them I will use my ATM card</RelQBody>

			<RelCText>Here is the thing; the shopkeepers are brainless idiots! Why? Take my local shop for example. There are no price tags on anything. You have to ask them 'how much is this'. I don't know the prices of anything in there. So when you go to pay; WHY tell you 11.50; with gum; just say 12 bloody riyals! How the hell am I going to know?!! That way I won't get annoyed at thinking I am losing money. They could do this without causing half the arguments. Do I want to pay more for my shopping? No. But I have never been into a shop and said '20 riyals? I am SURE my bill is 19.50'. They are so stupid.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Well I think it’s a rip off. No such thing as the best bank. I left Doha Bank because of poor customer service and went to QNB which am happy with. With QNB; you have to have a minimum of Qr 3;000 in your current account always. It’s a compulsory savings scheme. Plus; you get .25% in your savings account and if you take out a mortgage loan you pay 8.5%. Be careful; read the small prints. I don't trust banks here.</RelCText>

Coz to clean my feet and nails would take at least an hour; plus cleaning the ingrown without causing you to bleed; wounded...is a feat. (no pun intended). These women who works in the salon works from 8:30AM to 11:00PM; no overtime pay; salary is about 1000-1500 a month and some of them only have HALF DAY offs. They are provided with accommodation and Free transportation but they buy their own food. The measly tip they get helps to augment what they earn. A little generosity wont hurt; right?</RelCText>

She eats th same food as us; has her independence and is happy - her brother out here keeps thanking my friend for the recommendation.

			<RelCText>"One of the best customer services I have experienced in Doha is at the Commercial Bank. They never neglect your emails when you complain; they try to understand every detail of your problem and give you options to solve it; and they keep following up until you are satisfied. I have a similar pleasant experience with the manager of the service center of United Cars. He makes sure to read your emails and sends instant instructions to his employees to fix the problems. Unfortunately there are companies who don't bother if their customers are happy or not. They come from a background of: ""take it or leave it...you don't have any other option"" My brother experienced this lately with QGRABS. They sell some cheap quality offers and they don't bother to even apologize; not to mention a compensation."</RelCText>

Unfortunately; youâ€™ll find allot of shallow youth wondering on shopping malls; with no interest in education; employment; religion or life matters. Their only concern is having a posh car with unique number! As if it really matters. Yet; there are some educated youth; socializing and volunteering in good deeds.

			<RelCText>"that's my experience; too. I guess it's more of the culture; where it's more difficult for the ladies to widen their social circles. But overall the qataris I have met; both men and women were all lovely gracious people. That said; however; one of my pet peeves here are how ""some"" ladies in Abayas have no respect for queues. Twice i've had an abaya wearing lady step right in front of me in a queue. The thing is; what made it worse was; both those times the queues were not long. In fact there were 3 people max. I mean; how long am i going to take paying for 1 t-shirt? Another time; i was in the ladies room at the movies and waiting patiently in front of of the stalls and again; another abaya lady steps right in as soon as the door opened and the person inside came out!

			<RelCText>Its a wonderful device which I am sure you will love using Just ensure you buy the old version which can be unlocked very easily here. From my previous post -------------- All the US iPhones that came on week 45 and after have the 1.1.2 firmeware; with the new bootloader version 4.6. Those phones can still be jailbroken and activated; but there is no software sim unlock solution yet. To find out the week on your iPhone check the 4th and 5th digit of serial number. This number can be found on the bottom of box in which you received the iPhone. if it is 45 and above then there is no software solution to unlock the phone right now; Hardware solution TurboSim is your only option I guess. If you Serial number indicates that it is less that 45 then your iPhone can be unlocked. If not your choices are 1. Use TurboSim or similar HW method to unlock. 2. Jailbreak the iPhone and use it like iPod touch till a software unlock method is published. hope this helps --------------</RelCText>

			<RelCText>You could ask for a phone whose manufacturing week is less than 45. ( which can be verified by the serial Number.) I wonder if apple stores will stock phones with less than 45 weeks manufacturing. You could try other sources besides apple as well. In the worst case apple iPhones are also available in Qatar except that they are slightly (or very) costly. As far as unlocking the phone is concerned have no worry. Dandy here seems to be an expert at it. Still if you have any problems unlocking let me know; I will do it for you and if required teach you how to do it. (without any deal.)</RelCText>

			<RelQBody>Do any of you use a GPS to get around in Qatar? If so; does it help or hurt more? I was thinking of uploading the Garmin Middle East map but one person told me it's irrelevant since streets are re-routed there often. Just thought a navigator would make getting around a little easier when we first start driving but I don't want to blow $120 on something useless either.</RelQBody>

			<RelCText>No need wasting your money for specific GPS unit; all you need is just a mobile phone with GPS capability. Install it with GARMIN for mobile and complete the map of the area you need. Or just used google maps if you don't want get headache of renewal the maps.

			<RelCText>I cant understand why people buy electronics in Qatar. I get all my stuff off of Amazon and have it shipped by Aramex. It costs me about 25% less even with the cost of shipping.

			<RelCText>Online transactions are safe if you know your way around a pc. If your in doubt - use a pre paid credit card. I use aramex as well. The service is not all that great. They received two items from amazon on the same date and shipped one a week after the other. But amazon customer service is very good. You don't need to go their office to set up the account. You can register online from their website for a ship and shop account as well. Only reason why I would buy something from here over amazon/aramex is when I feel the local warranty is required or if I need it immediately.</RelCText>

			<RelQBody>I purchased a Nokia mobile phone from Carrefour about three months ago. I can barely hear out of my phone now; which is a real pain in the rear; to say the least.

			<RelCText>you can have it repaired on Nokia (Consolidated Gulf. Co. W.L.L.) in Salwa Showroom at 443-0666. if it's still under warranty; they will replace it with free of charge.

			<RelCText>They can't do it on the spot bec they have other things to fix or attend which was first on the line. you have to leave it and comeback after a few days. As ive said; Amoud; its probably under service warranty of 1 or 2 years not so sure with 2 years. so it will be free for now. Im sure carrefour will just bring it to Consolidated for SErvice afterwards and it might take a longer time than bringing it directly to Consolidated.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"They may keep your phone for a few days to fix it; longer depending on the availability of spare parts if needed . If you need a temp phone let me know; I have a few lying around the house (I should be at the Mums coffee Thursday morning). Good thing about Nokia is; that even if you dont have the receipt they register the serial number and have it on the system so your warranty is still valid even if you lost the receipt. ___________________________________________________ ""Diplomacy is the art of saying 'Nice doggie' until you can find a rock - Will Rogers"""</RelCText>

			<RelCText>All my phones in Doha; i purchased it from Consolidated Gulf Co. (NOKIA) Showroom in Hyatt Plaza; City center.

			<RelCText>If your mobile is under warranty..you can have it repair or if its beyond repair.. then they will replace the earpiece..like what happened before to my Nokia mobile.. I cant open it.. what they did.. they replace the face of the phone for which the on &amp; off switch is connected( they change it cz it can't be repair)... Like Amoud..I suggest you go to Al Nasser Branch which is just opposite or adjacent of Doha Clinic.. say 100 meters opposite DC..you can look for Merla.. she can help you with your problem...hope this would be of help to your problem...</RelCText>

			<RelCText>QIS is a good school and has excellent results. The pastoral side is too very good; with caring staff. Qatar Academy maybe the school where money is no object but the academic standards are not as impressive; especially in Primary. Doha College is a good school but fees are high; Primary section ws a school that merged with the existing Doha College - secondary school. DESS is also a British school here - mainly British kids. Noticed you are from the Netherlands; there is a Shell School in Doha that has the Dutch curriculum incorporated into it. Hope that this all helps; warning there is a huge demand for schools in Doha as the expat population is increasing more quickly than new schools can be set up - so get your children down an a waiting list ASAP.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>We relocated our teenagers in August and finally settled for QIS and are very pleased because the school has been extremely helpful and supportive in accepting two non-native speaking kids into year 10 and 12. We can recommend the school to 100%. Our kids came from the liberal Swedish school system but have settled very well. We have visited ALL English-speaking schools in Doha; and the only problem is that they are all full. Waitlisting and constant telephone calls to find out if something is happening is my advice. We spent 6 months before coming to Qatar to find a school; including 2 trips to sit entrance tests. Nerve-wracking - a week before school start we knew they had a place....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Once you are done w/ ur medical exam you can check w/ the medical commission at least after 3 working days. Just show your receipt number or passport copy at the male counter section and you'll get to know if its ready or not. For a medical employees it usually takes about 2 wks to have the results done due to other test (e.i. creatinine test) that has to be sent to HMC for investigations. In your case; you are only required to undergo blood test(HIV) &amp; Chest X-ray(PTB); so i think it wont take long that much. Dont you have mandoop/representative for your company? he is supposed to follow up all these things and you can always check w/ him. Good Luck!</RelCText>

			<RelQBody>hey guys. I`m a nurse here in the phils. i just signed a contract for hamad as a staff nurse. the offer is 5600 qatar riyals per month plus 1000 qatar riyal for transportation allowance.

			<RelCText>Regarding the starting salary;if it is your 1st stint to work as nurse overseas; that looks to be fair.with regard to the transportation allowance of QR1;000/month it seem to be reasonable only if your accomodation and the hospital are located in the same city. i mean if you will be assigned in Al Khor or somewhere far and your accomodation is in Doha; then that might need to be adjusted. Hamad provide pretty decent housing or the other staff gets housing allowance. I am not a nurse but I know some nurse working with Hamad. Hamad is a government Hospital and in general they give higher salary than the private clinics/hospitals. Can you provide me Hamad's Agency and contact address in the Philippines as it could also be an option for my nurse daughter in the future. She just passed the nursing board exam and barely starting her 1st job this month.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"Your salary is fair enough for an entry level nurse; the question is where your accomodation will be. bachelor accomodation means you will be sharing with two to three persons per flat or apartment; nationalities of which you will be sharing it with will depend on the vacancies available. there are 4 HMC hospitals; plus one for openning this year; in doha all located in proximity of each other with one in far off al khor; if you will be assigned in al khor; your accomodation will be in proximity of AKH. its a different environment than back home; not all patients know english.

			<RelCText>Hi Tinkerbell10; Your comment seems to originate from utter frustration. As you might have observed; in many aspects Qatar takes Dubai as a role model where such exit permit; 2 year ban etc does not exist and therefore the world love that place. Qatar; while trying to attract international attraction eventually has to remove such bondage rules. For example; the employees can keep their pass ports but they cannot exit the country without the consent of their employer sounds like an irony. If people come to work in Qatar on a 2 year contract; they should be given choice to renew or switch to another job after successfully completing the contract. I hope the perception of Qatar Govt will change eventually to catch the international attention..as a moderately free place.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Hi Tinkerbell10; Slavery in one form or the other existed in several parts of the world from time immorial. But those days ideas of globalization; equality; freedom of speech; right to information and service were also not there. I fully agree with what you have mentioned of the malls ans labour camps. But someone has to voice such plights to the public in some reasonable way. At least that we are discussing this issue now.. may be some one else would discuss this in another plat form where there could be a wider audience.

			<RelCText>Qatar will change and for the better; remember how far Qatar has come in just 15 years. Yes it has the money to do it but it has taken other countries 500 years to change this much but they didn't have to swamp the countries with foreigners to do it. Imagine living in your own country and being outnumbered 8 to 1 by foreigners. That is not an easy change. Slowly things are getting better but don't expect overnight change to benefit your individual needs.</RelCText>

The development came after Apple warned earlier that the update would render “permanently inoperable” devices that had been unlocked by owners who wanted to choose which mobile network to use. – DPA http://www.gulf-times.com/site/topics/article.asp?cu_no=2&amp;item_no=175573&amp;version=1&amp;template_id=57&amp;parent_id=56</RelCText>

			<RelQBody>For all of you shoppers out there. On July 31; a GAP store opened in Villagio. It is at the end of the canal near the ice skating rink. The best part is; the prices are comparable to the original stores in the States. I just wanted to let everyone know. Also; a Banana Republic is opening soon in Villagio. Maybe an Old Navy is next?</RelQBody>

			<RelCText>Don't worry; Qatari's do a good job of wearing fashionable clothes as well as traditional clothes :) I don't really like GAP; but I do like their stretch shirts (which I like to wear under a t-shirt).

			<RelCText>And another point to note is that sizes which will actually fit Western people often don't fly off the racks as quickly in other countries. I loved going to Gap in Japan; as I could find clothes which actually fit me in the clearance section; without paying an arm and a leg. Normally I don't shop at Gap either; but it became a must-visit whenever I saw one. Can't wait to visit the Villagio again-- they took me to the Middle Eastern restaurant in Villagio for dinner on my second visit day; and then we strolled around for a bit afterwards. The whole Venice motif rocked!</RelCText>

Without sounding biased; you will ALWAYS get great deals and when my father says you get a guarantee; you get a guarantee 100% no questions asked. King Koil is one of the best mattresses around. Tell you what though; say that Khalifa Saleh recommended you (Saleh Haroon's son) and you might even get an extra discount! ^_^ As for Ikea; I have bought two mattresses from them in the past; I've had them go wonky or unshaped within 6 months and Ikea refused to even talk to me. __________________________ I Love Qatar - http://www.iloveqatar.net</RelCText>

			<RelQBody>hey guys. I`m a nurse here in the phils. i just signed a contract for hamad as a staff nurse. the offer is 5600 qatar riyals per month plus 1000 qatar riyal for transportation allowance.

			<RelCText>Regarding the starting salary;if it is your 1st stint to work as nurse overseas; that looks to be fair.with regard to the transportation allowance of QR1;000/month it seem to be reasonable only if your accomodation and the hospital are located in the same city. i mean if you will be assigned in Al Khor or somewhere far and your accomodation is in Doha; then that might need to be adjusted. Hamad provide pretty decent housing or the other staff gets housing allowance. I am not a nurse but I know some nurse working with Hamad. Hamad is a government Hospital and in general they give higher salary than the private clinics/hospitals. Can you provide me Hamad's Agency and contact address in the Philippines as it could also be an option for my nurse daughter in the future. She just passed the nursing board exam and barely starting her 1st job this month.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"Your salary is fair enough for an entry level nurse; the question is where your accomodation will be. bachelor accomodation means you will be sharing with two to three persons per flat or apartment; nationalities of which you will be sharing it with will depend on the vacancies available. there are 4 HMC hospitals; plus one for openning this year; in doha all located in proximity of each other with one in far off al khor; if you will be assigned in al khor; your accomodation will be in proximity of AKH. its a different environment than back home; not all patients know english. Good luck! For Mr. Lucero; the agency that i know of is universal staffing services in makati located near south superhighway near border of makati and manila.

			<RelCText>hello; I'm a Biomedical Engineer hired by unistaff also last June 12; 2012. I got a call from unistaff that my visa is already with them. I went for my medical last Sept. 20; 2012. They told me that they sent my passport to the Qatar Embassy for Visa Stamping. After 1 week they called me and told me that my passport with the visa stamp is already in POEA for OEC. Today (Oct. 9; 2012) they called me and asking me to go to their office for the PDOS. Tom. (Oct. 10; 2012) will be my PDOS. My colleagues (also Biomedical Engineers) already have their plane tickets; they will leave on Oct. 13; 2012. I am hoping to leave sooner also (CROSSED FINGERS! :D). Patience is virtue.. I believe whining/complaining/getting angry/making endless calls to Ms. Marie will do us any good. Let's just wait for them to call us. Holding our papers/visa/passports won't make them richer neither won't make them any happier; those papers will just stack up in their office. They are just following the right process so.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"Dr S; I have checked with a friend doctor at Hamad Hospital; and these are some feedbacks that I gather : 1. HMC plans to become a full fledged Specialist Hospital soon; therefore they don't take in Residents anymore. Anyway; there is an exception to this...if you're enrolling the ""Arab Board"" Program; you'll be appointed as Resident. ""Arab Board"" is a 4-year program to become Specialists. 2. To enroll the Arab Board; HMC together with Weill Cornell Medical College conducts a yearly entrance exam (normally in Sept). In the recent exam; the passing mark was 55. 3. Salary for Resident is about QR 8;200/month (excluding Housing). 4.

			<RelCText>Who asked you to go for an MRI; that doctor can give a referral for hamad hospital; requesting a MRI. Appointment can take upto a month. I don't think it's necessary for the phc dr to give a referral or that you need to check again with a dr at hamad. I had a referral once directly from A private clinic for an MRI. but rules change. You can check with the dr you are following up your problem with; ask him or her for a referral and then go to hamad hospital X-ray MRI unit and check about the appointment. They are usually helpful; and if they appear uncooperative; please complain since their customer service takes such things seriously; but I don't think you will get such a problem. Their staff is usually helpful; sometimes it can take more than 3 staff members to give you the right picture but they will try and help you and guide you.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Secure a health card if you have not done so already by visiting the Health Center of your area with a pp size photograph and QR 100. (Of course you need to be an RP holder to be eligible) It might take a couple of days or even more to be with you. With that in hand visit your local health center again and see any GP with your complains; let him refer you to some specialist in Hamad related to your complain. Take an appointment of the specialist in Hamad. If luck is by your side and depending on the specialization you have been referred to; it might take somewhere between 1 to 6 months before you could see the specialist. Last time when I was there to take an appointment for evening clinic (not free even with health card); I was told that the appointment system itself is being upgraded and no appointment is possible until January next year. So watch out. Now if you are really lucky and you get to see the specialist and he feels that you need an MRI Scan done; he will issue you a paper .....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Hi flexicode; you can see a doctor at hamad without going through the health centre. I have had two appointments with different doctors and one for my family member; by directly asking for an appointment.ofcourse you don't get the appt immediately; depending upon the doctor; some specialists are available within a week's time; while renowned consultants have a std waiting period of 45 days; miss that appt and the next one is after another 45 days.grrrr;downside of waiting to meet a consultant is that if he is on a casual leave on the day of the appointment; they don't inform you and some junior dr will see you; beats the point of actually taking an appt with a consultant and then waiting to see him. It helps if you have a referral and a referral by a private dr should be fine too. Most important is to have a health card;once you have applied; they issue you a receipt; you can use the hospital services with the receipt.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I must add that they keep changing their rules so one month you can get an appt over the phone and the next month they would ask you to go to the phc first for a different appt. Moreover getting an MRI done outside could cost almost 1500 or more;depending upon the area being scanned. But it depends on how worried you are about your condition; and the cost is nothing; you get your results quickly; but if you can wait; its better to get into the national health care system; its not costly; and let them take care of you. Hope you feel well soon.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Firstly thank you all for the quick and informative responses. Nobody has actually ASKED me to get an MRI; but I want to do it myself as I am worried about my back. My lower back has been aching me for about 2 weeks now; and yesterday the upper right side of my back starting hurting. I visited a Doctor and he instantly told me that it is NOT a slipped disc; and is just a muscle spasm as the pain doesn't extend to my legs; though I still want to be certain as I want to start working out again; but I don't want to mess with my back if I shouldn't. And he said the upper back pain was also normal; and not related to a slipped disc whatsoever. Thanks again!</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Hello; sad to hear about your back pain. Your dr is right; if your pain is not extending to your limbs and are not feeling any pain or numbness in your fingers or toes; feet; then you don't need to worry. It's possible that you have injured yourself during your workout or is due to your work position; the way you sit at your desk; the way you sit while driving etc. Slip disc would give you excruciating pain; even simple tasks can become difficult; I am not sure if slip disc is the same as disc bulge; but in a disc bulge; if it starts touching the nerve; then you can have crazy tingling pain. You can try asking for an appointment with a dr.arun at hamad hospital in the evening clinic; or try to meet him at alkhor hospital. He is available in Doha only on Tuesday the other days; he is in alkhor.waiting time can be long; because he quite sought after. You can also meet dr.bhat at Doha clinic; he is one of the best and a longtimer in Doha. I would advice you to refrain from weight training.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Hey han19; Thank you so much for the reply; and the advice. I feel so much better knowing that it hopefully most likely is NOT a slipped disc. Being so young; and having started a new career; it would really not be a good thing. I have stopped weight training completely for now which sucks; but do you think it would be a good idea to introduce it very mildly? You think jogging is okay? I want to meet a proper Doctor; even if at a private hospital; as the guy at Hamad was busy; and only barely gave me any advice. I am sure a proper doctor can give me advice as to how exactly the right position is to sleep; to sit; etc. Maybe can give me some exercises to do to help me recover faster. You know any Doctor; even at a private hospital you specifically would recommend? These problems are to do with the Radiology section is that right? Forgive me as I know VERY little about hospitals and such problems; as I have had very few problems in the past (touch wood). Thank you again</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Hi Hmd; I would not advice you to do any strength training till you back pain subsides. Are you a heavy person. Brisk walking is preferred to jogging as in jogging you are putting a lot of impact on your lower back; as well as our knees. If you are a heavy person then you shuld try to avoid jogging n skipping.brisk walk is great again body posture is important. The stomach muscles support the back; so you need to firm up our stomach. A good physiotherapist can suggest some basic exercises; especially for the back and they really help. They are very simple; if you are into exercises u should know the cobra posture; cat stretch; simple leg lifts while lying down. For sitting position try to google office ergonomics and they usually have a standard picture that shows how one should be seated at an office desk. Wile driving; if you drive long distance; you need to move your neck frequently. You may call Doha Clinic hospital; and ask for Dr. Bhat; he is very good and his treatment is usuall.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I was not allowed to sponsor my husband on family visa either. Luckily I was given married accomodation when I first arrived and refused single quarters. I could sponsor them for a visit visa but they could only stay here 6 months at a time; go back home for 3 months and then we started the process of visit visa again. After almost 3 years of going back and forth he finally got a job and subsequent his resident visa. Although the Labour law allows it if you meet certain criteria; HMC does not allow it.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"LP ?? ""The ratio of males to females (8 to 2)"" ?? This Statistical data is probably 5-6 years old. Besides; it considers all laborers in qatar. If we take professionals only; I am afraid; the ratio today is other way around; 2 to 8 or close to it.. when last time did you go out? Drop by any decent night club and you will see what the latest real ratio in Qatar. On the New Year Eve I went to Crystal in W. I felt like in the discotheque somewhere at least in Barcelona. So many beautiful girls were around!! Some with the guys; some by themselves in the groups of 3-5-7! At some point I started regretting that i am not a lesbian.. As for the wife sponsorring her husband; it's not about HMC policy. Although there is a law that allows wife to sponsor her husband; each such transaction is processed by the authorities on case-to-case basis; involving consideration of different factors. And the main factor is a wife's Job designation."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>h! dear As far as i know you can easily get a tourist visa easily but the difficult part is entering/passing Philippine immigration. I would suggest to ask someone from qatar to play as sponsor in behalf of ur fiancee; much better if its a woman bcoz Qatar culture doesn't tolerate such things that a guy will sponsor a girl without any immediate relation. in addition to; the Phil. immigration might ask u for additional docs like sponsor letter; bank statement; show money; married cert if your married etc. just to satisfy them that ur genuine visitor in the country. I will advice u to go to an agency so they could help u find an sponsor.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Non-muslim men cannot marry a Muslim lady i believe you will have to convert and face a tremendous amount of difficulty; this is not a normal event in Qatar. Other questions can arise about children; that's why u get married; in the past they could not automatically be Qatari! either way Qatar is changing; the fact that you can meet a Qatari lady and get to this stage in your relationship could not have happened in the past without male relatives deciding to avenge such an insult! proceed carefully!</RelCText>

			<RelQBody>HELP. I am currently dating a man who lives in Qatar for work and is from the UK. Lately he has been talking about me moving over there.  What do I need to know? Can a single man and women live together?  Any other important things I should be considering? I am 31; I like to go out for drinks and have a good time. Is this going to be an issue?</RelQBody>

			<RelCText>"Well; for one thing; you don't just move to Qatar. You have to have a residence visa; which means you have to be sponsored; usually by a family member or an employer. They're not going to let your BF sponsor you. Can you live together? If you don't mind living illegally; sure; you can live together. Whether this in fact turns into a problem will depend on a whole lot of factors; but you should be aware that it CAN turn into the sort of problem that spells p-r-i-s-o-n and d-e-p-o-r-t-a-t-i-o-n. You can drink; lots of people do (I do); but you will be in a Muslim country under Sharia law. You would be well advised to be very discreet. Lastly; Qatar would not be my first choice if having ""a good time"" were all that important to me. I think of it more as a place that one navigates as best one can. It's not all that bad a place to live; but you do have to be somewhat resourceful."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>unless you really really really and I mean really like the guy! Come for a short visit and see it for yourself; check the place out. And as k977etc pointed out you'll need to find a sponsor; (i.e. employer) to be able to move here.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Qatar is amongst the more liberal of Gulf countries I believe; which isn't saying enough because the Gulf does not even compare to the liberality of the fertile crescent Arab countries like Syria; Lebanon and Jordan. Though I personally don't drink; the vast majority of people I know do; and they do not seem to have a problem accessing it (which makes for some interesting weekends I can assure you!) Where in the US do you live? And what are your qualifications? Have you considered looking for a job here? If you are thinking about getting married to the guy; I believe he can sponsor you; contact the American Embassy for more info (though i never found them to be particularly resourceful lol).

			<RelCText>"Yes; you can live together - You'll need to be discreet; i.e. do not tell your muslim friends and acquaintances about it. Yes; you can go out for drinks - No need to be discreet here as long as you consume in bars and night clubs (which are almost always in hotels) and your home. During Ramadan you can only drink up at home and it's common practice to stock up on booze before this period. Also; never ever get into trouble with the cops when drunk. Drink driving is definitely not advisable. But; I agree fully with ""OOO"". Come in on a holiday and see for yourself before you decide."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>If you have a valid driving license from your country of origin; you can drive a rental car for a period of seven days. However; if you have an INTERNATIONAL DRIVING LICENSE; THERE IS NO TIME LIMIT. Before the seven-day period is up; you will need to get a temporary driving license that is valid for the period of your visa. All nationalities may exchange their country of origin's license for a temporary Qatar license; however you may not do so if you have already started the residence visa process. If this has been started; you will have to wait for the visa before applying for a permanent license. To obtain the temporary license; you will need to apply in person at the Madinat Khalifa Traffic Department; where you will be required to complete an application form. This will have to be completed in Arabic (there are a number of typing shops within the confines of the traffic department who will assist; for a small fee).

Some people has no driving license driving around Doha and when they meet accident they run and leave their vehicles because they can be in a serious trouble in this country! or Some people are driving legally using their International Driving License but in process of the local Driving license as you cannot avoid it; you should apply for the local one too! In my case; before having the local driving license; I was depending on my Int'l Driving license; since I arrived here for at least 7 to 8 months; I had an accident and had my Resident Permit and showed it to the traffic police and voala! my car is fixed back to it's beauty!

			<RelCText>think of something... then try it here... like visiting the desert... well; i know it's not new to some of you;but it's new to me. Doha has plenty of nice restaurants to go to.  After eating; peace and relaxation is easy to find here... it's everywhere. Go for spa in Al Sharq.  Go have a drink... try the night life... try cinema 9 at city center one of those has nice couch... try horse back riding... learning how to motorbike... try skating... try moroccan food...  try indian food... filipino food... thai food... try playing a ps3... try wii... sorry.... got carried away....  hunt for new gadgets; doha has quiet good priced items.  laptops are cheaper here compared in most countries. The high demand for it has brought down the prices... if i wasn't able to help you still... there are lots of groups who always socialize every weekends... there's some nationalistic groups; art groups; religious groups; hobby groups... you'll be able to find them in book guides like marhaba/ qatar ha.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Here are a few (not tried and tested) but you can always get adventorous : 1. Ask personal questions to the most snobish salesman at a snobish outlet. 2. Talk in a higly accented english with the same snobish salesman (rehearse beforehand- another way to kill time). 3. Give a fake smile to people at corniche. Make it snappy like a flash. 4. Make funny/scary faces at kids on corniche. 5. Make a list of all swear words you know and keep the list ready for use (in purse/besides phone/in your car). 6. If you are working than prepare a list of important phone numbers in the smallest font possible and stick it on your computer monitor with a bright sticker. Think and analyse the reaction of your work mates on weekends. Bye and cheers.</RelCText>

I am educated but I have tutored Arabic for non-Arabic native speakers for many years during my stay in the States; whether for Arab Americans who do not speak Arabic well or Americans; Mexicans; Brasilians; Europeans and some Asians. I set up my own notes and lessons into three different levels; Beginner; intermediate and advanced. I do so to organize things and meet certain expectations of what the student is looking for. Note to the visitors of this website -- since this posting; i will check the website daily just in case. Otherwise; if you are interested; you can email me at hamoorabi69@hotmail.com I have kept my tutoring notes that I used with students and I do use a small writing board or a big writing board with colors to make it easy on the student on how to read and how the letters are connected to gether.

			<RelCText>"Wait and only apply to Doha English Speaking School. If they get accepted then leave the UK. This school is only British school which follow the actual British curriculum and is monitored by the British educational council. All the rest of the British school claim they ""follow"" the British curriculum. Who is there to monitor the school? If you PAY for a private company to accredit the school; they will come out and give you accreditation. You will find out that your child will be a year behind because majority of the schools don't have the textbooks for each subject in the class. Nor do they have a curriculum without textbooks or manuals. Sadly; the teachers have to deal with the parents as to why their child is behind because the Principal will pond you over to the teacher for any complaints."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>DESS although the best has LONGGGGG waiting list and is until primary. For me ; no harm putting them into the waiting list &amp; pray that you will get a place. To me there are other good ones like Doha College; Parkhouse; Sherbourne &amp; Doha British School which you can consider. Due to personal preference; I have seen parents transferring their kids within these few schools too. Alternatively you let your husband settled here first.. find a school before you guys come over. All schools require entrance exam before they are accepted. So whenever a place becomes available; do prepare to fly them immediately.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>There are some great new schools opening; for instance the International School of London or the American College School (though obviously not British curriculum). I've switched my daughter from Park House (a British school I STRONGLY recommend you avoid); to the aforementioned ACS-- they had immediate availability; being so new. Also; many schools have relationships with certain companies; so check if that is true for your husband's company. Good luck!</RelCText>

			<RelCText>My husband also works for Qatar Airways. Now is an excellent time to apply for schools here as they are sorting places for Sept 2012. I am a teacher and it was a worry trying to get our daughter into a school. We arrived at the wrong time of year and it took a while to get her into a school so I had to home teach for a while. However; this time last year we got our daughter into Doha College. She has come on in leaps and bounds and we are thrilled with the school. The school has recently been inspected and did extremely well. They use the British Curriculum so the transition from UK to Doha College was very easy! Your children will need to sit an assessment but it's nothing to worry about. You will also need previous school reports from their current UK school. Other schools that we were impressed with were DESS and Sherbourne. Hope that helps! Good luck! :)</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"I disagree with Expatemily (I am a friend in real life with her) Park House is a great school. Also loads of Qatar Airway people. I have 3 kids in the school. Other good schools (based on my dealings with the schools and friends comments) are Doha (Montisori) British School; Doha Collage; Doha English Speaking School. These four schools are also ""reasonably"" priced. The American schools are crazy expensive. I suggest applying to all of those schools now (as in today!). Places often open up over the summer and Park House requires a deposit on next year from current students in May for September so you could still easily get places. Having 3 children is an advantage because one one gets a place it tends to bounce the others up on the waiting list."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"Everytime I log on here and see comments about schools I chuckle at the amount of best schools that are listed. To date I believe there might be about 6 ""best"" schools in doha; based on what; usually perception based on how well a particular child is doing at that school at that moment. It seems to me that if a child is struggling or not doing particulalry well then first thing to do is blame the school ""it must be the school"". A well motivated pupil will thrive in most environments and from what I have come across so far most of the schools are okay; as long as they are not for profit...we are never going to replicate a top british school but why would we want to as one of the benefits here is the multi culturalism. Of course places are tight but I dont think people should stress as much about the schools. I have a child of 13 who will either go to DBS or DC but personally I would have him in ASD (no chance) but not because the rest are rubbish just because I personally got a better f....."</RelCText>

On 1 side there are the women &amp; children of the original owners of the land who were living peacefully like every nation on earth; and on the other side there are the women &amp; children who left their countries around the world; came to invade a country which don't belong to them; started killing the families of the original owners; and stole their homes.

			<RelCText>I do not support in any way the treatment of the Palestinians by the Israelis and the tragic loss of life of innocents is unforgiveable. What I do not understand though is why certain Palestinian factions continue to fire home made rockets into Israel. What good does it do? It takes away sympathy from the Palestinian cause and it causes innocent deaths on the Israeli side of the border. Worse of all; everyone knows that the Israelis retaliate with much greater force and cause many more innocent palestinian deaths. Stop giving Israel an excuse to kill. Use brain power not gun powder. Look to the examples of Ghandi and Mandela to make change and get the Isrealis to return to 1967 borders. These stupid rockets just cause more unecessary deaths.  </RelCText>

			<RelCText>"dear mackman.... IF U R CONFIDENT ABOUT UR PROFESSION; AND U BELIEVES U CAN DO THE WORK UR SELF IN UR ROOM OR ANY OTHER SAFE PLACE....... dont worry to buy a visa; as telling the seller it is not a free visa; it is either a company visa or house maid/driver visa(good is company visa) i m now in qatar since 2006 under ""free visa""(company visa). i didnot happened any problems until now.not only me; thousands of people are still in qatar under ""free vias"". They r doing job;in another company; by giving No Objection Letter from his real Sponser. As telling FREE; u r free (freedom) from ur real sponser. If u get a good opportunity u can change ur job; but all time u need the No objection letter form ur sponser. But after 1 year only; u will get No objection letter. if u want to transfer ur visa u can do it after 2 year ONLY. really the slavers are the others; becouse they are always facing the THREAT of TERMINATION......"</RelCText>

			<RelCText>lymisaj; you are giving false information to public; as others mentioned there is no Free visa; there are some people selling few visas by their influence with Sponsor and allowing him to work outside (illegally) and none of the company will appoint you unless you have proper visa; once you got a personal sponsored visa you cant change your visa for another 5 years and within this time you are working here illegally and if they catch you you will be in jail and will be deported. If your visa is under any company you can chage after 2 years. Always good way; apply for jobs in Qatar with your qualification; now a days most of the companies are getting business visa under their company and later you can change to work visit. Some times Free visa holders stuck in this country and you may never meet your sponsor after you arrive in this country and may not get Exit permit to go for vacation or Emergency situation.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Hey ! Welcome to Qatar. Every job market has its fair share of positives and negatives. Getting a job in qatar is quite tough depending on the channel you use to source for jobs. Also depends on your expectations. There is vast majority of job seekers in Qatar who consider themselves qualified in many ways but often find out that the expectations of the employer are much higher. Also; you should try to be more specific. For eg: in the question you placed; you could have easily mentioned what kind of position you are looking out for to let everyone know in one go. But you chose not to. In addition to this; most ministries and govt organizations are implementing qatarization policies. So you will find a decrease in very 'high paying' jobs for expatriates. The private firm would not probably pay you as much. To avoid dissapointment you could try to filter the interviews coming to you. Ask before-hand what to expect in the interviews. The sources of recruitment / agencies are easily access.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Crazy88; Thanks for your reply; you were right on why I didn't mentioned the job position I am applying for; but I was just saying in General; I mean I wasn't asking for a job more than asking about any company that hiring now and why is it difficult to find a high professionalism organization. about the recruiting agencies; I did many search and got many recruitment agencies; but thought if someone could provide with a good one.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>You don't have to be defensive. I pointed out a defect that you can work on to get better chances. It is not about social network Vs Email to your boss. You can get a slight chance for a job offer through qatarliving. Would you rather hire someone that can't write correct English if you can hire someone that can? Also; why would you even mention what I have on another thread? You don't even know the full story? Again you contradict the true meaning of professionalism. My other thread is due to people who take money and give you a fake receipt and do not deliver. How is this my fault? Good luck to you; based on my poor judgement; you might need a lot of it.</RelCText>

Wasta; I have but lol kat i dont have the right wasta so im out of here. even with a catchy; professional cv it all came down to wrong visa. lol and they say being American with upon arrival visa is transferable.... ya right.... Can u be my wasta? It is EASY if you are on husbands rp; just need patience as this is Qatar they move slow in HR; but they get over 100+ applications a day.

			<RelCText>It could very well be true. Qatarization is a very high priority here. But with that said; saying that Qataris should fill secretarial positions and getting them to do so are two different things. A national is going to have to want the job before the job is Qatarized. I'm not sure how this would be handled so I don't see it happening overnight. I'm not sure if this refers to replacing people already in positions or for new positions opening up. One would like to think that expats will keep their job until their contract runs out at least. Also - it could be that a qualified Qatari is given first opportunity at a new position and if it isn't filled then it can be opened up to expats. In any event - it will take time to sort out.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"I can see it happening overnight indeed. In my organization we have four administrative positions sitting empty that have been reserved for Qataris. No one wants them; we had one woman for a while; but she quit after a month as her husband thought that it was too far for her to drive. What silliness; we can't hire anyone to fill the positions as they are reserved for Qataris; but we can't find any Qataris willing to take the jobs; and nothing is getting done. Why are administrative positions considered to be ""unskilled"" anyway? A good admin assistant is worth their weight in gold."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"the ""pecking"" order for jobs has always been Qatari first; second was other arab and third was any other nationality. Admin jobs (particularly HR) have always been seen as an easy Qatarisation option. It's not like an operational job where; if somebody screws up; there's often a big bang or an accident. HR and its systems can slowly deteriorate with no apparent effect......until the system does collapse and by then it's often too late. Enter the expats again to sort things out. One comment.

			<RelCText>There is that store in City Center; opposite and up a bit from Home Centre. Can't remember it's name;  maybe GSM? they have some herbal medicines like Milk Thistle and vitamins; some packets of fibre and bran type things but really it's more for bodybuilders I think; they have loads of those powder drinks and stuff. depends what you are looking for.

			<RelCText>Scarlett; I bought flax seed recently.  The line is Infinity Organic in a light brown packaging at Megamart @ The Centre.  I also got Cranberry juice there; unsweetened but perhaps blended with another juice.  Dewlands is the brand.  Milk thistle is available at GNC as is Dandelion root capsules but not the tea.  Hmm...that covers all your requests except for flax seed oil...best bet Megamart.

			<RelCText>I will have to look again for the seeds as I shop Megamart all the time and have looked but not found any. will try again with a concerted effort then! Found flax seed oil but it was on a shelf and it requires refrigeration..it wasn't...plus it was 118 riyals for a very small bottle...ouch!! ohh thanks for letting me know about the others..i'm going to CC today to get some!!  Most folks are about as happy as they make up their minds to be. --Abraham Lincoln (1809 - 1865)</RelCText>

			<RelQSubject>Minimum wage for house maids.</RelQSubject>

			<RelCText>There was a meeting held at Philippine embassy last week and they tackled about this matter. One of the requirements in submitting agreements in embassy is Labor contract signed by the sponsor indicating the salary of $400. We are still waiting for the confirmation of the additional requirement. Once the labor contract will be attached to the housemaid's agreement; the indicated salary will be implemented.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>When I bought over a maid for slightly less monthly sum I was informed by my colleagues that m paying her too much - they pay around USD 200 - 250. In the interest of all there should be a minimum wage however my maid sends home 95 % of her salary - I remit it myself to her mothers account. She eats th same food as us; has her independence and is happy - her brother out here keeps thanking my friend for the recommendation. The point is the salary I'm paying is less than the OP cap and she is more than happy. It is in multiples of what she was earning back home</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"... but locals are obliged to wear it. I was told at work that they even get an allowance to wear the costume (not sure from the company or the state). They are not supposed to wear anything else while in Qatar. It is sort displaying that you belong to a certain race when you're in a minority situation; and i'm not going into the VIP territory again. As for western women wearing it; as long as you're not walking ""alone""; it should be OK. At the least you should be walking with another woman; preferably wearing the same. If you two get into a Landcruiser at the end of your walk; that's even better :) Moudir"</RelCText>

			<RelCText>As some of you have suggested; to apply for permanent residency in Canada is pretty straight forward o majority of the cases.  The Green Card is only referring to permanent resident of the States; not Canada.  Also; the color of the card for permanent resident card has been changed to white color many yaers ago though most people still refer to green card. To qualify for Canadian permanent resident visa; you  need to accumulate a total of 67 points (used to be 75 points) which are based on your age; education level; profession; employment status; english proficiency; suitability; and among others.  Just go to the official canadian immigration website as stated above and u will get all the info.  God luck~!</RelCText>

			<RelQBody>We are thinking of moving to Doha next year. I'm due my second baby in March. My first son is 3 and is currently being assessed for Autism; with which he has a speech delay. 2 questions... 1. What are the baby shops and childrens facilities like is Doha? I presume you can get most things there. 2. Are there; and can you recommend a health facility that would be suitable for my son to continue his speech therapy and ASD assessments? Many thanks!</RelQBody>

			<RelCText>"Hi Cat; I just wanted to congratulate you on your pregnancy. You will find that there is lots of baby gear shops in Doha including Mothercare; The Baby Shop; Toy's R us; Chicco and others. So yes; you will find here everything you need for your little one. I'm not sure what you mean by ""children facilities""; if you refer to medical care; I think is really good. Please do a search about child-birth in this website and you will find lots of info. I'm not familiar with special needs health facilities here in Doha so cannot give you a personal opinion; but the Marhaba magazine talks about to centres; so it might be a good starting point for you to enquiry about speech teraphy and assessment: Shafallah Centre: The opening of the centre's new state of the art facility in West Bay in 206 offers worldclass facilities and education for special needs children in Qatar. It includes a 150 bed hospital and stadium. The Learning Center: This institution is part of Qatar Foundaztion and offers a numb....."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Welcome to Doha and congratulations for ur pregnancy. I would like to take this opportunity and talk about bare facts regarding Autism care in Doha. My son is 7 years old and is undergoing OT in India. He is diagonsed with HFATS - high functioning autistic traights spectrum. he is joining me by last week October'07. There are just 4 neurologists in this country. I will write their names tomorrow as I do not have them handy rigth now. there is one Neurosurgeon in Doha clinic - he is more of a doctor for orthopaedic patients. Second is a lady neuro paedratic. She is in UK for her knee transplant an should be back in Doha in first week Nov'07. I did meet both of them and their feed back is neuro care is absolutely zero in Doha. There are two more neurologists in Hamad hospital. Havent met them yet. Shafallah center is for complete mentally challenged kids. I met the officials there and they would not do any OT training to outside kids. The kid has to study there and that is where our kids.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>The choices for support of special needs are limited here; folks. I've lived here for 15 years -- I should know! My preschooler goes to see a Canadian lady who works with him on his speech delay/pronunciation problems once a week. She is licensed; qualified and very good. I pay out of pocket over $80/week for one hour of services for him. I would NOT recommend either Shafallah or The Learning Center. The former is for severely mentally disabled children (mostly locals) and the latter is a school but; again; populated mostly with locals and it's a watered-down curriculum with few genuinely-trained specialists on staff to deal with the types of things you're thinking of *they're mostly regular teachers who have had a few inservices on working with kids with ADD -- that's about it).

			<RelCText>"As a woman here in Qatar; I encountered the same problem when I moved here last year...I was told ""long sleeves and long skirts"". That is not entirely true; esp. in the summer when the heat is unbearable. Your wife can wear capris (knees do need to be covered) and short-sleeved tops as long as the neckline isn't too low. The benefit to long summer skirts is that they are actually cooler than pants. The general rule is that it shouldn't be too tight or two revealing. Also; keep in mind that they run the A/c on high everywhere; so your wife will probably want to keep a cardigan with her to wear around on top of short sleeves when she is in restaurants; malls; etc. You are arriving in October; so the weather will be fine; like spring weather in the States; very pleasant actually. Last winter it actually got quite cold here; so bring jackets and even a light-weight winter coat (or heavier if you intend to travel during winter). One other option: a number of western women do wear abayas aro....."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>surfcatgolferdude. cover up is not normal here for expatriates. covered shoulders and covered knees is not a must. Let your wife relax. Think of it here as a conservative western country. The rule is to protect herself in a way that she does not dress anything that could be very very revealing and tempting some horny guys to bother her. very trasparent trousers or shirts or blouse is not rcommended. very very short skirt is not recommended.

			<RelCText>I agree with Kelly here; for expats; its alright to wear sleeveless (well; considering the weather here now) and skirts……just don’t show more skin than usual And of course; If you don’t want to draw unnecessary looks from guys/lookers here; it is very intelligent to cover up…you will see what we mean when you set foot here… basically; everything is acceptable as long as you don't draw too much attention with what you wear..</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"Your wife can wear just about anything she wants as long as it is decent. The muslim ladies are totally covered up; cos according to Islam; the beauty of the woman is for her man only. I recommend that she wear ""normal"" clothes; this is totally acceptable for ""western ladies"". And at a club or at home anything. But when you go around to a supermarket or shopping mall I recommend she wears a little more covered up. This is not because of the Islamic point of view; but more for her own protection.

			<RelCText>I have it on good source that QP receives about 10;000 on-line applications per month. Unfortunately; there are apparently not enough internal QP resources to adequately screen all on-line candidates; so your best chance is to know somebody within QP who can apply a little pressure to move your file to the forefront. If Mystica is willing to help you on this front; I would say go for it.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>You can only send 3 applications online and the 4th will be invalid. They are giving 90 days; for them to process the application and truly they contacted the short listed one.

			<RelCText>I have seen many well qualified job seekers not even considered for interviews at companies like QP and RASGAS while people with NO EXPEREINCE and hardly any qualification get into good posts there just because they know some on in the recruitment division.

			<RelCText>Here's a tip; you should first read the job requirement and qualifications; then you should cater your resume/CV to what they're looking for. Most big companies don't really have real people going through those resumes/CV; they have a software that look for keywords. In short you shouldn't have just one set of resume and always follow-up on your applications don't wait for the company to contact you. Hope this helps. If anyone needs help on there resume/CV; I can always spare some time to look it over. JhunBug</RelCText>

			<RelCText>There is insurance but it applies on death only. So you have to find a job. If the company where you find already is in approved list; no need to worry. Just present the offer letter &amp; a letter from the company ( new) that your visa is under process. On receipt of letter; please approach your branch. If you don't find a suitable job &amp; want travel ban so that you can find a suitable job; please make sure that you give guarantee cheques against your loan to bank so they will do the rest.

			<RelCText>making any kind of loan in the bank; they said to be your assurance that you will not be deported here in the country. it is now a common tactics by the employees to loan in the bank for personal interests; they want to work or let us say to be stable here in qatar for a long time. your company will have no choice but to release you that if you have in good terms with your company. in my two cents; in your case that your employer is not willing to give you a NOC; there is something misunderstanding or dispute going on with you and your employer. and that's a different story now if in that case. we are invisibly handcuffed by our sponsor here for all we knew. we cannot easily do what we want to do here. so go on to the flow with the system of your company. all of this is just my two cents. good luck bro. http://qatarliving.com/node/6201601</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Patience there's no guarantee that your company will give you NOC. It is their sole discretion. Only you can try and explain your situation.

			<RelCText>Well it is not your work out here that matters but how you go about your other things; taking a big loan for example is an insurance in itself that the sponsor cannot cancel your visa and kick you out. If your current sponsor is not going to give you a NOC then just let the bank and your sponsor settle the matter between themselves.

			<RelCText>Kat yep very true about the type of work you are experienced in; if the position can be filled local the mindset is.....why hire a American that will want more salary then a different nationality? Wasta; I have but lol kat i dont have the right wasta so im out of here. even with a catchy; professional cv it all came down to wrong visa. lol and they say being American with upon arrival visa is transferable.... ya right.... Can u be my wasta? It is EASY if you are on husbands rp; just need patience as this is Qatar they move slow in HR; but they get over 100+ applications a day. IF your CV is eye catching and has what they need; you will get a call for interview.</RelCText>

Better try to stay for 3 months; in 1 month nothing will materialise unless you know some big shots to take care of you. But do not resign your current job. Hold on as standby.

			<RelCText>these are two different things.. Tepgam67 is asking about Work permit while being on Family visa. shapil is talking about residence permit. that's what happens when unprofessional people try to give an advice. Tepgam67; if you have an RP here; to obtain a Work permit you need police clearance and the contract certified in MOL. How long it takes to finalize the process depends on several factors. ometimes it takes 3-4 days; sometimes it takes 1 month and even more. If you don't have an RP here (i.e. you are on 6 months family visa); you cannot work; and therefore you cannot obtain a Work permit.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>you are welcome; shapil; it is never late to learn. again you mix two things. You are already on Work VISA here in qatar. Based on your Work VISA you got your RP. You don't need an additional work PERMIT; since your visa is a WORK visa. Clear? Work PERMIT is required for those who are on the Family Visa and wish to work. The author of this thread is on Family Visa and already has her RP; I guess. She might stay in Qatar on Family visa without working (while you cannot stay on Work visa without working).

			<RelCText>Hi; If your spouse is under your sponsorship: meaning the visa indicated on his/her Qatar ID or Resident Permit is Family Visa; then there is no need for them to be sponsored by an employer unless you feel that there will be more benefits that you can get if your spouse will get to be sponsored by the company they got accepted at. But if your spouse's visa is just Family Visit; and they landed a job with another company and you cannot have him/her under family visa; you just have to submit a No Objection Letter to transfer the sponsorship.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>bringing him on family visit visa (6 months) and sponsoring him for the Residence permit are two different things. Even IF you are able to bring him on a Family visit visa (6 months); he won't be able to work with this type of visa. The Company who hired him will have to issue a Work Visa for him and will have to take him under its sponsorship. As for the Residence permit; you won't be able to obtain RP for him (which is necessary for the Work permit) under your sponsorship. So this is not an option for you. All you need is to TRY to bring him on Family visa 6 months. THen he will need to find a job and to move under the hiring company sponsorship.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Once you are done w/ ur medical exam you can check w/ the medical commission at least after 3 working days. Just show your receipt number or passport copy at the male counter section and you'll get to know if its ready or not. For a medical employees it usually takes about 2 wks to have the results done due to other test (e.i. creatinine test) that has to be sent to HMC for investigations. In your case; you are only required to undergo blood test(HIV) &amp; Chest X-ray(PTB); so i think it wont take long that much. Dont you have mandoop/representative for your company? he is supposed to follow up all these things and you can always check w/ him. Good Luck!</RelCText>

It's not because things are difficult that we don't dare; it's because we don't dare that makes things difficult!</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Hai guys I have been working in qatar since 1995 in a reputed company as a supervisor. The title of my visa was labor.As uyou said it doesn't make any difference until I try to bring my family here; Because we are not able to bring our family if our visa in such title even we are working as a manager ; I canceled my RP while I go on vacation and cameback in new visa as engineer. I heard that even we we can visit UAE for 7 days if we had a engineer or doctor visa (not sure).</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Salleh...salary is relative to what you do for a living. Having said that you can be the best judge of how good or bad your offer is once you've done some research. DO a search in QL. Plenty of threads bout cost of living in Doha. 1. 2 br apartment 8500-12000 pm 2. Groceries for two 2500 pm 3. Water + electricity 500 pm 4. Telephone+internet+cable 500-100 pm 5. Car rental 2000 pm for the likes of Corolla/civic 6. School fees....sorry no idea 7. Other....no idea..depends what your definition is Hope this helps. Good lucK!!!!!</RelCText>

			<RelCText>LOL this thread is such a reality-slap in the face; i remember back when 4000ryals was enough to live large back in the mid 1990's And now the guy is gonna make 15000 a month and we all feel bad for the struggle he will go through! Qatar is overpriced and definetly overrated; unless your a lebanese pimp i dont see how u can survive in qatar or what your doing here in the first place?</RelCText>

			<RelCText>If they can't house you then you dont take it. Or at least get it in the contract that they will pay your Housing Rent Bill as the rents increase 25% every year. If they agree then the package is good unless you are not a heavy dirnker. Bilabong is on the spot with the rates. No.5 is optional and it would depend on the length of your stay. If you Rent-a-car it will be QR2000. If you stay for above 3yrs then it would be better if you buy QR2000 pm for 3yrs you can own the car (corolla/civic) &amp; sell it for QR 25;000-30;000 when you leave Qatar. If your wife is here &amp; she is not working it could be damn boring for her.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>hi Salleh; after reading the above definition of leaving in qatar u might have gone craze dont feel so; what i feel is 1 Rent : if you search you will get 2 BHK at 5000-6000K 2.Food expenses for two : 1500-2000K 3.Car : 1000-1500 K (if u are buying a car) plan of staying more than 3years; 4.School : 500-600K per month; 5.Other misc. expenses : depends on you; In my opinion 10000K per month should do; think over and deicde</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Is that I can't see a problem with going off topic if the thread is a light one; such as Paul arranging a social get-together or someone putting up a joke for everyone to have a go at or add to etc. I think the problem is if someone has started a serious thread; which requires a discussion or even an answer to a query they have (if it doesn't fit in the more serious forums); then by hijacking it kind of kills the thread and serves no purpose. Speaking as someone who found this site when in the UK; before coming over to Doha; I typed into google a question about; say; sports clubs in Doha and found a thread in QL. It was informative; but I wonder what I would have thought of the site had the thread suddenly disintegrated in people gossiping and heresay and bickering? For a start I would never had seen some of the REAL info I was looking for and given up; as probably would have the person who posted the question in the first place expecting some knowledge to be imparted! OK - am going to.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"Don't worry Scarlett; you are not the first and will not be the last. It seem to happen in the Qatar Living forum more then any of the others. Jauntie is right. I found QL by googling Qatar schools and I found this sight. If all I had found was bickering and guys trying to pick up women - I don't think I would have come back to it. It has been a big help. I have read so many of the threads and come back all the time to read more - informative and very entertaining. I hope to get there soon so I can join the Social Group. There are some very interesting people here that I would love to meet in person. I love meeting people from different places; cultures; etc. We have been expats on and off for many; many years. Nice to see another ""Southern Bell"" on the sight. I am not in Doha yet. My husband is there and I will get there eventually. Take care and enjoy your time in Doha. Lisa"</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"Um_Nooh and aquabong; With all respect to cleaners and tea boys. I do respect them a lot and if I had to use ranks; I would consider them all; way above most of the people who exercise a ""management"" position here in Qatar. Each one of them have a sad story behind them and most of them are heroes suffering under an unjust society. For your information; from where I come from; a cleaner and a person who serves tea/coffee; is regarded as important as a senior manager and their salaries sometimes are not too apart. The social benefits are equal. We grow up with a diversity of people and racism is just not part of our upbringing! My reply to Um_Nooh; came out that way because of the way she posted her question! Anybody could figure out that salaries vary in accordance with the activity you are going to exercise. Um_Nooh assumed that either we could guess her qualifications and targeted job; or whatever. My answer was deliberated for her to think about her error and at the same time to high....."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Nic - when i talked about lack of class and respect; it had nothing to do; and was not directed towards individuals that work as tea/coffee servers; and hence lead to me feeling offended.... it was directed to how you answered me! You were the person that I felt lacked class and respect (and that is without knowing your professional background). If you want to talk about answering; and stating things appropriately; you could have chosen your words in a more decent manner. Follow what you preach basically. The fact that not only I was offened but another member as well; who if I may add is NOT qatari; shows a lot about your approach. Please do not assume that just because I am Qatari; I do not value people that work as tea/coffee servers; or anyone else for that matter! Just as you assumed the worst in me; and thought I sterotyped them as being low class citizens; you were a hypocrite to assume that as a Qatari that is how I would think of them! The only person that acted wrongly is you.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>hello; I'm a Biomedical Engineer hired by unistaff also last June 12; 2012. I got a call from unistaff that my visa is already with them. I went for my medical last Sept. 20; 2012. They told me that they sent my passport to the Qatar Embassy for Visa Stamping. After 1 week they called me and told me that my passport with the visa stamp is already in POEA for OEC. Today (Oct. 9; 2012) they called me and asking me to go to their office for the PDOS. Tom. (Oct. 10; 2012) will be my PDOS. My colleagues (also Biomedical Engineers) already have their plane tickets; they will leave on Oct. 13; 2012. I am hoping to leave sooner also (CROSSED FINGERS! :D). Patience is virtue.. I believe whining/complaining/getting angry/making endless calls to Ms. Marie will do us any good. Let's just wait for them to call us. Holding our papers/visa/passports won't make them richer neither won't make them any happier; those papers will just stack up in their office. They are just following the right process so.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>It's depend on the job grade; usually they offered cheap package as compare with other industries or companies in Qatar. They offered me for Technical operation staff.. but people in QL advised me its a very less package to service in Qatar. Keep all the things in mind and than accept the offer bcz accommodation is the biggest problem in Qatar. But there is no harm to attend the interview; it will be a short trip for you.

			<RelCText>NO an air bus cannot stay still; at any moment during flight. The wings cross section make it such that most of the air is forced downwards and smaller fraction over the wings; pushing the plane upwards. Air must be moving toward the plane for the wing to push it below. So the aircraft must be moving towards the air; to get this effect. for the smarter ones out there; you should know that; the speed at which the air hits the wings (basically the aircraft speed plus speed of opposing wind) is proportional to the amount of lift given. helicopters are the same; only that the rotor blades; are the wings and they constantly move in at circular path.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"Not only can an Airbus (or any other commercial aircraft) not ""stand still"" in the air; it must be going at least 155 knots (or approx 175 miles per hour) in order to stay in the air; relative to the wind speed. If it falls below that relative speed it will simply fall out of the air. I remember in the middle of one flight; a passenger called the flight attendant and asked; ""Why have we stopped?""

			<RelCText>Technically; a commercial jet can stay still in the air provided we cause the wind to blow at it from the opposite direction at over 600Kmph. This wind must blow towards the nose and through its wings to cause it to get lift force and thus not make any displacement relative to the ground. This wud means it has zero ground speed. An aircraft has two speeds namely groundspeed and airspeed. Airspeed is measured by the amount of air rushing thro' its sensors placed at various points on its outer body. This mechanism and physical aspect of flight is beyond the scope of this discussion and many of you won't even be able grasp the idea.</RelCText>

The OWWA told her to go back to the embassy.So my friend decided to be deported coz no one in our phils govenment agency here didnt help her.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I believe that the shipping company in the states coordinated with one of the local moving companies and handled most of the paperwork. When our shipment arrived we simply had to find the moving company here and give them a map on where to deliver the goods. There may have been other steps handled by my wife or her company; but it seemed fairly straightforward. Your employer and/or moving company should give adequate instructions. Be aware that they may quarantine and return later anything that they think needs to be reviewed for content; like DVD's; VHS tapes; books; CDs etc. It seems our labeling of boxes helped them in this effort and so some of our DVDs that were in the labeled boxes arrived after quarantine while others that were just haphazardly packed were delivered on the first shipment. http://www.xanga.com/BBetz</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Hi Fitri. i am from India and have come in to Doha 8 days back. The delay in the process is only at the level of the directore I'm told. Apparently once the goods arrive in Doha; the local agent contacts customs and sets a date with them to inspect the goods. This takes up to a week. after customs goes through ALL items; they give their estimate and clearance. There is a tax of 5% on the goods being brought in levied. However household goods are exempted from the tax and the agent applied to the directorate for exeption. This is where takes time and I'm told can take upto 20 / 25 days to gte the clearance. Thus the option seems to be to either pay 5% of the valuation they have done or wait.</RelCText>

I DO want to gauge excatly how severe/negative the response would be if I did; say; decide to travel to the beach in a pair of shorts and a tank top with bikini underneath. Some of the clothing I own (and love!)now I wouldn't DREAM of wearing out there. I'd probably be deported... :P BUT; I was at least hoping to hear that some people do still keep some of their original dress habits without too much backlash. I guess I'll just have to see how it goes when I'm out there. Maybe I should do some more research on Islamic Customs; but can anyone explain why women are required to cover shoulders/knees in the first place? I'm very curious. Thanks."</RelCText>

I have been to a few in the last few months; and have been very disappointed.  The ladies seem to be competing with each other in the dress department; and so some outfits are very outlandish... There seems to be so much politics amongs the different groups of ladies sitting at the tables; you know.. this group doesn't like that group; or this part of the family feel snubbed for some reason....

			<RelCText>I came back from Europe last week with 2+ kilos in my checked bag - as did at least a dozen others on the same flight. Alcohol will be confiscated; no doubt about it; but the pork seems to be winked at as it goes through the scanner. I've never heard of anyone being detained or arrested for bringing either into the country - the alcohol was simply confiscated and they were warned not to try and bring it again. Nationality and ethnicity may play a role here. I'm a white Western middleaged female. Asian and other people of colour may have a different experience and perhaps someone can speak to that point. Many Westerners here travel to UAE or Bahrain and bring back pork with no incident (in my 2+ years here).</RelCText>

			<RelCText>doha to dubai. first; you can ship one of the cars; i am told it will cost about 2K QAR/AED. you will need to get a transit visa for the drive through saudi; and for this you will need a valid GCC residence visa. aside from this; i would have thought that you just register the car with the ministry of transportation once you are here (but not sure if that involves anything different than what you would need for a car bought here). if your car is too old you won't be able to register it in doha (i think 2006 models are the oldest allowed this year). no idea about the stuff but good question. i wanted to do the same; it would not have occurred to me that this might be a problem.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>i just moved in here. if your visa will be cancelled come august; then i think you can no longer drive it i tried actually all the procedures. if you're planning to export it here through either recovery (trucking) or shipping (container) the first thing you'll do is go to Traffic department; the easiest and less crowded is the one near Al Wasl; 10am is a good time to go there. they will get your vehicle for export test and you have to pay for 25 dhs. then if you tell them you'll bring it to trucking company yourself; you'll pay around 80dhs for the export plates (blue plates) and they will get your old plates and also the registration of your vehicle (card); make sure too you cancel your salik; which has also a booth inside the building. here are the reminders: 1.) insist you'll take the car even with the blue plates; some of the guys will tell you to leave your car with them. with the blue plates; you can drive your car for 14 more days from the day you had the local plates canceled......</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Hi Cath; I'm also planning to take my car from Dubai to Doha. However; I have a couple of issues: 1. I just moved to Qatar a couple of weeks ago and haven't received my Resident Permit yet because they told me I have to cancel my Dubai visa first (even though it's my own investor visa) 2. I'm going to Dubai tomorrow to cancel my visa and then I was planning to come back in my car. Will I be able to obtain the transit visa in Saudi border if I have a Canadian passport? 3. If I get an NOC from my employer in Qatar; will that be sufficient to import my car from Dubai to Doha. 4. Will I have to pay the 5% tax if my car is 3 yrs old? Is there any way to avoid it?

			<RelCText>"As a woman here in Qatar; I encountered the same problem when I moved here last year...I was told ""long sleeves and long skirts"". That is not entirely true; esp. in the summer when the heat is unbearable. Your wife can wear capris (knees do need to be covered) and short-sleeved tops as long as the neckline isn't too low. The benefit to long summer skirts is that they are actually cooler than pants. The general rule is that it shouldn't be too tight or two revealing. Also; keep in mind that they run the A/c on high everywhere; so your wife will probably want to keep a cardigan with her to wear around on top of short sleeves when she is in restaurants; malls; etc. You are arriving in October; so the weather will be fine; like spring weather in the States; very pleasant actually. Last winter it actually got quite cold here; so bring jackets and even a light-weight winter coat (or heavier if you intend to travel during winter). One other option: a number of western women do wear abayas aro....."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>surfcatgolferdude. cover up is not normal here for expatriates. covered shoulders and covered knees is not a must. Let your wife relax.

But when you go around to a supermarket or shopping mall I recommend she wears a little more covered up. This is not because of the Islamic point of view; but more for her own protection.

			<RelCText>Lol; anyone can wear an Abaya. But if someone goes on the current trend of TIGHT fitting ones with shiny stones and designs; without the Hijab; and with DRAG makeup or in some cases they just let it all fly back while they walk into a mall making it look like an advocate coat. So whats the purpose of wearing the Abaya again; if you want to show your body to the world? lol; when I see the other nationalities wearing an abaya apparently they dont do it to cover their body; they do it to look pretty and to look Qatari :) Correct me if Im wrong. Hope your not one among these people. Once I was in Landmark and I saw a Qatari (I guess) with an open Abaya wearing Super man tee inside. What the devil did she want to potray?

			<RelCText>it kinda gets pretty cold. As DaRuDe said; 8 to 10 degrees. This may sound high; but when it rains or there is a wind; it feels much colder. I will second DaRuDe; last year; there was a shortage of room heaters in Qatar; people were even willing to pay a premium for a small one. Better to be prepared than spend sleepless night shivering with the cold. Granted the cold snap does not last long; but who would want to give up their sleep. Days are pretty warm. Last year; I think; it was about a day or three that was very cold during the day and that was due to heavy rains.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Yes it's alright for men to wear short sleeve shirts.Like you said the more conservative;the better and that rule applies to men as well.As this is a conservative muslim country;total respect for local customs and traditions need to be observed.Women aren't advised to wear sleeve less shirts or tops as well as shorts.Business dress code is the same as anywhere else.For men formal suiting and for women nothing specific bit it has be decent so as not to offend anyone and more importantaly;to avoid any sort of unwanted attention.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>just for woman you can wear short sleeves and not above the knee length skirt or pants but the most important thing is your blouse should not reveal your .... when trying to pick up your grocery(as i've seen myself how the male cashier and other customers where staring at the woman with every procduct she tried to get from her trolly to the cashier)or if you have kids you have to follow or kneel for them ;so just something that will focus on your beauty in your face and anywhere else in the body;and good luck</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"Buddy; I got my licence on Sunday in second attempt...i have few tips for you... 1. Try Karwa driving school...it's better and professional environment there and staff is supportive..dont go to Gulf driving..its fish market and highly unprofessional..my colleague told me; he had to pay the instructor QAR100 every week privately to continue lessons else they wont bother &amp; that's bullshit. 2. You will need 2-3 sessions to understand how to master ""L"" parking on the ramp; Box (pocket) parking forward (Note- You have only one chance to move; no reverse-forward combination allowed.) Karwa charges QAR 100 for every hr if you dont take course.. 3. Road tests are offbeat than you drive every day e.g. Theory class say you need to exit roundabout in same lane you enter...but they teach you to exit in fist lane no matter which lane you enter (Thats police test requirement) and similar things. 4. Try to give the test in the same school you go for practice. 5. test sequence is -verbal sign test- ""L....."</RelCText>

Complete all your theory and on road sessions; and then take ur test. In case ;you( hope you do not) fail in first attempt; you can re-take the test by paying another 250 QAR.

			<RelCText>I know how it feels. The time for training; preparation for exams and postponement of exams date and all is really frustrating but like someone earlier said confidence during road test; slow driving and observation and following basic rules will do you alot. The trainers give too many rules to follow but on the exams day; the policeman wants to see your confidence and application of basic control moves. That's all. I wish you the best.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Things to do before you begin drifting... . . . 1. Set up a cone in the middle of the lot. Drive up on the cone and rip the handbrake in an attempt to do a 180. Practice this until you are no more; and no less than 180 degrees from when you started. . . . . 2. Learn how to countersteer by ripping the handbrake from a speed of 10-20mph and trying to control the car to a destination until the car stops. . . . . 3. Increase speed of each of these things until you are comfortable. . . . . . 4. try to do the 180 cone turn but instead of stopping; hit the gas hard and power out and away from the cone. Start practicing this first and let me know when you are confident enough about this... “We make a living by what we get; we make a life by what we give.” Sir Winston Churchill</RelCText>

They don't they don't eat pork; we do; we believe in Santa; they don't; etc. I then went on to explain about how some countries fight and go to war with one another and people get hurt and killed and it's never nice; but it happens. And hopefully soldiers try to be as careful as they can; but sometimes women and kids and old people and animals get hurt and killed by accident. It's sad but it happens.

			<RelCText>but I do like the way Umm handled it. I have a friend; she is from England her husband from Lebanon. Her son when it was coming up to national day told her that in NO WAY was he going to have anything to do with Lebanon because his friends did not like Arabs. This boys goes to one of the 'supposed' best schools in Doha. I told my friend; that if that was my kid; they would have gone to school with a Cedar strapped to their hand; some Lebanese food and Union Jack underpants.

			<RelCText>Here is a zero tolerance policy towards drugs and penalties for drug trafficking include the death penalty or life in jail. Penalties for possession or use of illegal drugs include imprisonment and heavy fines. Qatar has issued a warning to visitors to be aware of its strict laws against illegal drug possession. The presence of illegal drugs detected in blood or urine tests is considered possession. You may also be charged with possessing drugs if trace amounts are found on your body; clothing or luggage. Amounts of 0.05 grams or less can lead to guilty verdicts. Medication available over the counter or by prescription in your country may be illegal or considered a controlled substance in the Qatar. .</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Hello; I'm an american here on a fellowship to study Arabic at Qatar University. Unfortunately it is too late to enroll in classes there and class sizes are usually pretty big. I; however; have been studying Arabic for a long time and am basically fluent; I'm here to perfect my language skills. If you are looking for a private tutor I am available everyday after 2pm. My Arabic is quite good and as a non-native speaker I'm very familiar with how non-natives learn the language. I have teaching experience. if you are interested please email me. amyrusky@gmail.com Hope to hear from you Amy</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Salam; Hello; Bonjour; Hola &amp; Oi !! To all those who were looking for possible Arabic tutoring by a native speaker . . . I am a native speaker from Palestine. I am educated but I have tutored Arabic for non-Arabic native speakers for many years during my stay in the States; whether for Arab Americans who do not speak Arabic well or Americans; Mexicans; Brasilians; Europeans and some Asians. I set up my own notes and lessons into three different levels; Beginner; intermediate and advanced. I do so to organize things and meet certain expectations of what the student is looking for. Note to the visitors of this website -- since this posting; i will check the website daily just in case. Otherwise; if you are interested; you can email me at hamoorabi69@hotmail.com I have kept my tutoring notes that I used with students and I do use a small writing board or a big writing board with colors to make it easy on the student on how to read and how the letters are connected to gether. Plus; I make .....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Though I didnt pay anything to my teacher during my brief 4 days lessons....but normally they very less paid....(my teacher's salary was QR-700/-). So its always good to pay them some...after all they teach you the tricks of passing the test. Looting for around 500-700 Riyals is a bit too much. Normally people give them around QR-200 in equal installments of QR 50/- during their lessons.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>As some of you have suggested; to apply for permanent residency in Canada is pretty straight forward o majority of the cases.  The Green Card is only referring to permanent resident of the States; not Canada.  Also; the color of the card for permanent resident card has been changed to white color many yaers ago though most people still refer to green card. To qualify for Canadian permanent resident visa; you  need to accumulate a total of 67 points (used to be 75 points) which are based on your age; education level; profession; employment status; english proficiency; suitability; and among others.  Just go to the official canadian immigration website as stated above and u will get all the info.  God luck~!</RelCText>

Marriott wasnt that good; the food was nice but the sheesha was terrible as was the entertainment; small hall; no AC and very empty. Ritz Carlton.. Didnt go this year but last year it was amazing... Great Moroccan food; nice entertainment with dancers and live singers and the spinning egyptian man... great sheesha... I also heard that Diplomatic club is the best in Do7a but good luck trying to get a table; ive tried for soooo long and its always fully booked.. :)</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Ah; sorry Voyageress; bad wording on my part. They arrive on 28th so will experience a couple of days of Ramdan. I've heard good things about the InterCon one on the beach as well; but last year we went to InterCon one when it was inside and it was rubbish. Last two years we've been to Ritz-Carlton and it's been excellent; but it's expensive and we fancied a change.</RelCText>

If the batter is too thick add a little more milk. If it is too thin add a little more flour. Pass the batter through a strainer to remove all lumps. Lastly add the chopped cashewnuts and mix. Keep batter aside for half an hour. Heat a non stick frying pan and add a little butter. Pour spoon fulls of batter in the pan to make small pancakes.

			<RelCText>NEW DELHI — The remote; destitute state of Orissa; marred for years by Hindu-versus-Christian violence; erupted in a retaliatory killing on Monday after the murder of a Hindu leader led a mob to burn small Christian churches; prayer halls and an orphanage that had housed 21 children. The police said a woman’s body; charred beyond recognition; was found inside the church orphanage. The church’s pastor; whom the police did not identify and who was injured in the fire; told the authorities that the body was that of a nun working there. No children were injured. The attack on the orphanage on Monday; in an isolated district called Bargarh; came after the killing Saturday of a Hindu leader who had been associated with the Vishwa Hindu Parishad; or World Hindu Council; and who was leading a drive to wean local villagers from Christianity.

			<RelCText>BHUBANESHWAR; India: Protesters set fire to several houses in eastern India on Monday in an area where recent clashes between Hindus and Christians have left at least 11 people dead; police said. No one was injured in the latest attack in Orissa state; but police feared the arson will increase tension in a region with a history of violence along religious lines. Senior police official Gopal Chandra Nanda would not say whether the burned homes belonged to Hindus or Christians; but said an investigation was under way. The attacks took place in Tikabali; a town in Kandhamal district that has been the center of the unrest. Police have imposed a strict curfew across the district for the past week. The violence began late last month with the killing of a Hindu leader; which police blamed on Maoist rebels but Hindu activists blamed on Christian militants. In apparent retaliation; Hindu hard-liners set fire to a Christian orphanage; killing a Christian woman and seriously injuring a priest. Th.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Terrorism knows no race; colour; religion or creed; but its main aim is to wipe out the human race and so we have to stand united to fight it and remove it from the root. Which is a very difficult task concerning the fact that every race; region has its own outlook on terror and wouldn't prefer others pointing at them. Look at what happened to war against terror witnessed in Iraq; Afghanistan etc. This is a big disaster and look at all the innocent blood stains; will they ever be wiped off? Whatever is done so far to remove terror is caused its evil head to reappear in another form. First the Muslim terrorist kills the Christians the Christians plot a way to tackle it calling it war against terror and creates terror in Muslims and the rest of the world; Muslims Terrorists killing the mostly tolerant Hindus causes Hindus to become Terrorists and this blame game continues.

The official IDOP web site states: ""As a human rights issue; the persecution of Christians dwarfs all other forms of religious injustice. It is beneficial to take advocacy for fellow believers who suffer for their faith as a starting point; as Christians living in free societies have been largely unaware of or silent to this increasing tragedy."" I was just browsing the internet and came across this news story dated Nov. 8th. ""An evangelist in the North Indian state of Madhya Pradesh was killed by Hindu priests suspected of seeking human sacrifices for a Hindu ""goddess"" in the latest in a series of attacks against Christians in the country. According to the Global Council of Indian Christians; Vipin Mandloli; 27; was shot dead near Aamkut village in the Jhabua District; Madhya Pradesh."</RelCText>

Why just this morning on my way into work; a qatari gentleman in a really nice car basically barged into me and we would have had quite a bad crash if i hadn't been polite enough to just stop and let him in rather than have most of my car side taken off by him.

			<RelCText>I am suppose to be wheat intolerant but in this country I have given up and am bloated all the time. Mega mart also has wheat free flour to make your own bread; doubles up great for pizza bases; carrefore occasionally stocks wheat free nut bread. Simple treat for you to try is 1 c peanut butter; 1 c sugar; 1 egg. Mix all together; put spoonfuls on a greased tray and bake at 180 for about 20min (golden).

			<RelCText>"Megamart does have the best selection. Edensoy milk is some of the best tasting (especially vanilla). It comes fortified in some varieties. Read labels on everything. If the product is from the US; it will list CONTAINS MILK in bold letters on the bottom of the ingredients. Some poptarts are milk free (cinnamon; strawberry; and apple flavor). Be cautious with chocolate. Milk is in all Cadbury chocolate. Some dark brands are vegan. Megamart also has Soya margarine and ""Smart Balance"" butterflavored spread on occasion. My advice is to stock up when they have it! Also be careful when buying bread; as many have milk as an ingredient. I haven't found any dairy-free cheese in doha. Is the allergy just cow's milk? Can goat or sheep cheese be used? The pharmacy in City Center has chewy bears calcium vitamins if you are looking for supplements. Good luck."</RelCText>

Doctors - Most of the Indians look for Indian doctors because of either language and communication problems or they are not treated well (attitude).

However; we avoid going back to restaurants where we are not treated well.

			<RelCText>"Vma; in Nagaland(India); they feed the dog some spicy food and then force it to wash it down with some strong alcoholic liquer. Then they take the dog by the tail and give it a vigorous swing and shake it until it becomes sick and throw up. They collect the vomit and leave the dog alone and the vomit is used as a topping for a very special rice dish during ceremonial feasts. And BTW; they eat dogs;crows;rats etc in some parts of the north east too. So ""dog meat curry"" and ""dog puke"" is an Indian dish. I have heard that other Asians like a some Koreans(not all) and some Japanese eat ""dog meat"" too. Exotic food is popular in many Asian country. But Filipinos do it ""field rats"" and ""snake meat""; if I am not wrong!"</RelCText>

I am educated but I have tutored Arabic for non-Arabic native speakers for many years during my stay in the States; whether for Arab Americans who do not speak Arabic well or Americans; Mexicans; Brasilians; Europeans and some Asians. I set up my own notes and lessons into three different levels; Beginner; intermediate and advanced. I do so to organize things and meet certain expectations of what the student is looking for. Note to the visitors of this website -- since this posting; i will check the website daily just in case. Otherwise; if you are interested; you can email me at hamoorabi69@hotmail.com I have kept my tutoring notes that I used with students and I do use a small writing board or a big writing board with colors to make it easy on the student on how to read and how the letters are connected to gether. Plus; I make .....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>it depends on your aims. for understanding the whole grammar and be able to talk in the streets and for a basic understanding of what you've read you will need a whole year with 2 - 3 hours daily along with a lot of exercises at home. if you are a beginner i would suggest that you join the arabic classes in fanar building close to corniche. they have four levels. these levels will be enough for you as a beginner.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>English is not an easy language - but Arabic is much more difficult . Once I read from an expert that learning Arabic needs ten times more time and effort than learning English for example . The big problem is not the letters - they are easy to learn - but the words ... There are so many dialects that you have to choose one dialect first of all . Or if you choose the standard Arabic then you will understand speakers of news channels or religious teachers - but you will not be able to communicate or they will just laugh at you .... Sometimes it seems to me that there is not such thing that Arabic language . There are dialects which are similar to each other like French is similar to Italian or to Spanish .</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Friend; since i do not know arabic but i learn a lot of sentences and words only through verbal interation whch means Arabic is very easy language. In my opinion u can learn it within 3-4 months provided u have to devote yourself 2 hours daily. U can join FANAR center (building with spiral shape tower)near Al-fardan;infront of Irani market; Doha.They have nominal charges (Approx QR. 400 only for 3 months) If u need further assistant pls ask me through e-mail All the best my friend.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Fanar teaches written Arabic. After 5 levels and many months you will have a vocabulary of about 300 words; not enough to speak. You will need to choose a dialect and focus on the spoken language. I did an immersion course - 10 hours a day; six days a week for 8 weeks and I am conversational.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>as i said; 'almost' all schools; not every. i'm also trying in other schools for the next academic year. and can i take names(of the school) here? @angellinaballerina: yes it is good to learn local language; but u might not be knowing that Arabic is a very difficult language; and to expect the kids to learn something so alien to them is quite unfair. actually everything was hunky-dory till last year when the school was offering basic arabic for us and the numbers were also not included in the exam results. but this year they converted basic arabic to advanced arabic without informing the parents. so now we are in a fix.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>There is a regulated nursery service in doha but at premium rates and difficult to obtain a place; and now due to new regulations there are a reduced number of places. but with careful search you should be able to find a Nursery place. Do ask to see their Ministry registration. Outside of this there is the home provision by employing a Nanny; which is a costly activity initially. There is also many who will offer the service privately unregulated. Its your choice who you trust this small child with. Child care should be planned proir to the babys birth. we have nine months to plan for this day and children deserve the best decisions from us . check Doha Mums website . good Luck.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>It really is a personal decision and there are no wrongs or rights here.I can only speak of my experience and let you decide from there. We have 2 children one in pre4 at school and the other 3 still at home. We have a nanny who takes care of the 3 year old. We went through the newspaper and interviewed about 20 and had about 40 call. Out of 20 there were about 3 we would have gone with. We decided on one and it was O.K. but after about 2 or 3 weeks we let her go. Were going to do add again but through contacts in the building and info from our pervious add campaign we found another nanny. It has been about 6 months now and all is good. We need to revisit expectations once in a while but overall we are pleased. We have play dates arranged each week for the nanny to take our child and we have other expectations that we hope insure a nuturing and healthy day. There is good and bad to both senerios. My wife stayed home for a year when our son was 1.5 because we didn't like the kindergarde.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Hi; I contacted a nursery teacher who was looking for a job and i offered that she work as a nanny for my kids; 8 hours daily for 5 days a week and she asked for 2500 QR monthly. She also asked if i can give her a work visa. Is this a reasonable price? and is there a difference in the salary if she is on my sponsorship and living at my house or if she is on somebody else's sponsorship and live out? please provide your advice as soon as possiple. Alos; I would appreciate it if you can give me any contact info you have for other nanies you thought were good. you can e mail me at sosoya80@yahoo.com if you don't want to discuss this on the forum.

			<RelCText>Sorry; but 3 of my friends really doesn't like and had bad experience with koala. Two of them are parents and feel something not true and saw incoherence. One of them worked there and told us the worst things we could hear. What better we can know from a worker; a person who can see more than parents ! Actually; she told me lot of exemple that what they show to the parents is completely different than what's really happen there. So for that I really do not recommend this nursery !</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"rsher - Was looking in the latest Marhaba (welcome) book and saw that both Starfish and Creative Child take kids beginning at age 1 but if you get here at 10 months it might take 2 months or so on a waiting list anyway. Also; saw Mary Poppins Nursery. Haven't heard anything about this one except one mom was unimpressed when she saw a t.v. in one of the rooms. It's a little bit further down the road from Starfish. Emails - starfishkids@hotmail.com creativechildqatar@yahoo.com marry_poppins@qatar.net.qa (yes two ""r""s) Also; is there a Qatar Embassy in Canada? If so; give them a call and see if they can send you a copy of the Marhaba book. The Embassy in the US sent us one before we moved over. Lots of basic info on Qatar/Doha and pictures.

			<RelCText>My three-year-old boy is at Starfish Lane. He loves it; and I haven't heard any complaints from other parents. My only problem is that it's across town (near Landmark); so I have a long trip in the morning. When we arrived in Doha; we thought we were going to put Jamie into Tots Corner; which is very close to our house. It was full; and so were all of the nearby nurseries; so we went looking for a good nursery anywhere in Doha; and came across Kimberley; one of the owners. Now; I wouldn't change nursery - Jamie's settled into a routine and has his bunch of pals. -- http://all-abroad.blogspot.com/</RelCText>

Wasta; I have but lol kat i dont have the right wasta so im out of here. even with a catchy; professional cv it all came down to wrong visa. lol and they say being American with upon arrival visa is transferable.... ya right.... Can u be my wasta? It is EASY if you are on husbands rp; just need patience as this is Qatar they move slow in HR; but they get over 100+ applications a day. IF your CV is eye catching and has what they need; you will get a call for interview.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I have been doing research on this MBA thing in Doha for the last one year or more but so far I have found nothing worthwhile. The only options available were at Qatar university but I am not sure about its credentials and the second option was National education center somewhere near Lulu. They offer MBA evening classes couple of times a week and the degree we get is from Allagappa university of Madras. The third option is Doha Training Center; they had an ad in the papers a few weeks ago. They too are offering MBA thu some American university or atleast that is what they claimed but when I went there to check it out; it turned out to be some American university based in the Phillipines. Even the degree that we would get after completing it would say Phillipines on it. So I decided that it is better to do some distance MBA from my own country Pakistan than to go for that.. If any of you find out some good and recognized MBA degree being offered in Qatar; please let me know. Thanks</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Yes you can upgrade the ram in your laptop. This day and age; 512mb is the minimum for a good experience. If you can afford it; I say buy a new laptop with at least 1gb ram and a good processor. You don't game or do any media editting so you don't need to worry about having a speedy processor or a great graphics card. Watch out though if you get vista. Although it's supposed to be better; I find that XP is much better. OR if you wanted a great all in one solution. Get a Macbook. You can install windows on Macs now :) __________________________ Cost of Living; Visas; Safety Info; Tips on Moving; Facts; Pictures; Videos; and more!</RelCText>

			<RelCText>well to be frank the ACER is the third quality company as it is just good for small useage and not for heavy useage.. if u also upgrade it to the best stuff still ACER will get hang or go slow when u try opening any site which has a big size. if you take my request plz try selling it any cost and go for any company brand accept ACER sorry if i said or broke ur heart thanks</RelCText>

			<RelCText>My advice; keep this one for you as u dont need it for any heavy usage; and let ur hubby buy; heres the ones i have; all Acer Aspires; great; and both have Vista; although the older one has Vista Ultimate on it. I have had the following laptop for 2 years and a half. Centrino Solo 2.0; 1GB Ram; HDD 200 (upgraded recently) was 100 GB HDD; ATI Radeon 9800 Pro/128; Branded Acer Aspire; Costed me 8250 QR from Jarir; nothing and i mean nothing happened to it; and i only use it for gaming. I also bought another two days ago for my sis; its a core duo 1.8; 1 gb ram; 160 hdd; ati x series; with 384 shared memory; branded acer with all the bells and whistles for 2960QR. Came with windows vista home premium; the newest model checked on the acer website; catch it at carrefour before it runs out. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ./`I don't wanna waste another day-Keepin it inside; it's killing me./`</RelCText>

			<RelCText>The newer PC's come with graphic cards; which make memory intense games very nice to play. I guess it depends how often he plays games; and the intensity of the memory needed.

			<RelCText>"Uh that is such a general statement ""the newer pcs"". Sorry but no. That is wrong. Not all pcs come with graphic cards and memory intense games require alot of video ram not just a standard graphics card. I have two 7900 GTOs at 512mb each running on SLi config and I still have some system slow down with some games. She just needs a nice new laptop which should last her another 4 years. If she gets a nice processor; 2gb ram; and a large hard-disk; everything else doesn't matter and she'll be set for a good while.

			<RelCText>RAM upgrade is the cheapest way to go that if you only use it to check email and play game once in a wile. Usually laptop come with 2 RAM space and I guess that one is already occupy with your 256MB RAM. Other than that it's not worth it to upgrade laptop. People usually go out to buy new one cuz laptop space are limited and it's just too difficult to upgrade.</RelCText>

She also help me to find a job for my wife there.Its my first time to go abroad and kinda scared and at teh same time excited. I also have several officemates before here in the phil who are now working there. I hope i can find a way to cut-off my expenses and i will really tighting up my budget to save. The offer for the position is quite good if we will based it in our country but based on what i found in this site its quite small. But nevertheless im still young and probably find better opportunity whenever it possible.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>As far as the reputation of Al Fardan goes; it has a very good reputation in Qatar. They are rich as a company I guess; cause they seem to have their own Money exchange; High quality Jewelery shops; dealerships for Range Rover; BMW and Ferrari ... SO that does have some weight... I think they also have several businesses related to Finance and Oil...Hope this helps...</RelCText>

			<RelCText>It could very well be true. Qatarization is a very high priority here. But with that said; saying that Qataris should fill secretarial positions and getting them to do so are two different things. A national is going to have to want the job before the job is Qatarized. I'm not sure how this would be handled so I don't see it happening overnight. I'm not sure if this refers to replacing people already in positions or for new positions opening up. One would like to think that expats will keep their job until their contract runs out at least. Also - it could be that a qualified Qatari is given first opportunity at a new position and if it isn't filled then it can be opened up to expats. In any event - it will take time to sort out.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"I can see it happening overnight indeed. In my organization we have four administrative positions sitting empty that have been reserved for Qataris. No one wants them; we had one woman for a while; but she quit after a month as her husband thought that it was too far for her to drive. What silliness; we can't hire anyone to fill the positions as they are reserved for Qataris; but we can't find any Qataris willing to take the jobs; and nothing is getting done. Why are administrative positions considered to be ""unskilled"" anyway? A good admin assistant is worth their weight in gold."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"the ""pecking"" order for jobs has always been Qatari first; second was other arab and third was any other nationality. Admin jobs (particularly HR) have always been seen as an easy Qatarisation option. It's not like an operational job where; if somebody screws up; there's often a big bang or an accident. HR and its systems can slowly deteriorate with no apparent effect......until the system does collapse and by then it's often too late. Enter the expats again to sort things out. One comment.

			<RelCText>Personally.. i think the real estate industry may start a down slide soon; it seems like Rents have skyrocketed within the last year or two; It is likely that the asian games had soemthing to do with this and i just can not imagine the prices of real estate maintaining this insane rate for much longer. Something has to give. On the flip side of the coin; Qatar has been and still is expanding at a fast rate; there could continue to be a growth spurt and that would mean that more housing would be needed for workers...

			<RelCText>I just brought on Lagoon Plaza; so I am hoping the market doesnt come down anytime soon. Personally while all this building is going on and while there is a buzz about the place then I think prices for property will keep rising. I was reading a Dubai site the otherday saying prices are beginning to drop due to over supply. I think that problem is a long way off here. Plus I brought because my company will give me a housing allowance so they will be paying for my investment and when you look at it like that its a no brainer. Icidently I did look at the Pearl it is going to be very nice but just not soon enough and I think they are a bit over priced.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Hey. I looked at a place on the Pearl in Sabban Towers; which will be the first completed tower on the pearl. I; unfortunately couldn't get the finance fast enough so i lost the apartment; the tower is now sold-out. Property prices are rising roughly 10% per month at the moment and trust me that is not going to slow down in a hurry. They just will never beable to build fast enough to catch up with the demand as has happened in Dubai. I definitely think it is a good invetsment; even if the appreciation on the property slows down to 10% per annum that is still a good investment when you condsider the fact that you are currently just pouring your rent money into someone else's pocket or mortgage and you could be putting that into your on property which you can redeem when you sell the place. For at least the next ten years your investment will be very safe; that being said who knows what will happen if America goes after Iran? There is no return without risk though as i am sure you know a.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>What is the problem; I would maybe have a few doubts about the Pearl just becasue its reclaimed land but my tower built on solid ground out of concrrete. I think it will be ok for some time to come. The finishing in this country is appauling but you can't argue that the building are not solid.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Property even in the building I have brought in has gone up 20% since its launch. The Pearl is adding 10% to each phase. Its going to keep going; and you are right why should my company put rent money into someone elses pocket when they can pay towards my mortgage. I am happy with 10% apprication on the property. I would have got 5% in the bank and realistically its going to be more than that. 10 years is probably about the right amount of time to keep hold of it. By then you will have Loisil Wackra Al Khor etc all built and it will be an established market. Until then I am holding for the ride.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I am now considering Lusail as an option but i am wondering if it is going to be too far out initially and will show a slower appreciation. I have seen it happen in Dubai; the original western villa area is the Springs and Meadows near the Dubai Marina and the Palm Jumeriah. They have subsequently built the Arabian Ranches and while the Springs etc has continued to appreciate dramatically the Ranches is struggling a bit. Now i believe that the lagoons and the Pearl will soon become the centre of Doha and Lusail will be the suburbs do you think the places there are going to hold their value as well as the Pearl? Whats your opinion; i would be interested to know as you seem to have the same ideas about the property market that i do?</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"You sound pretty vague in your confidence; When you say ""I hope"" and ""I think"" but you conclude pretty confidently with the term ""no-brainer"". The prices of Lagoon are above a million for a one bed appartment. Such prices in the heart of Dubai Marina have now crashed to 0.55 million. Still Dubai has a higher brand equity and better business environment. I am sure you might have done much more research and assessment of the scenario before getting in. Please elaborate further on your analysis. Anyone who buys is pretty convinced of his moves specially when there is no clarity on ownership and legislation. The other factor that has literally killed the Dubai market is the very high figure of Annual maintenance charges of about 10AED/Sq ft/Year. Please share your analysis with us. PS: I am not critiquing or analysing your decision to buy. I am only seeking more information that you may like to share with us on your analysis. Quiet lurker. Poor Contributer"</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I have seen many well qualified job seekers not even considered for interviews at companies like QP and RASGAS while people with NO EXPEREINCE and hardly any qualification get into good posts there just because they know some on in the recruitment division. This is really unfair to those who spent years trying to build a great career and get a good position in some good company.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Here's a tip; you should first read the job requirement and qualifications; then you should cater your resume/CV to what they're looking for. Most big companies don't really have real people going through those resumes/CV; they have a software that look for keywords. In short you shouldn't have just one set of resume and always follow-up on your applications don't wait for the company to contact you. Hope this helps. If anyone needs help on there resume/CV; I can always spare some time to look it over. JhunBug</RelCText>

With this offer I guess you could save 1.500 $ x month if your life style is not too expensive. Moreover; I was well impressed about quality of life in Doha (I love sea and sailing). The reason why I rejected was that I had to move very quick and I was scared of such a big change in my life and no time for fixing some business in my hometown. My suggestion is to accept and enjoy!

			<RelCText>Dear fellow; That's relative...Compare the offer with what you gettin now; I mean your current income. Similar to anywhere worldwide ; you can live on US$ 1000$ / month or your expensenses may reach as much as ten times (10;000 $)a month. In qatar; a family can decently live with 8000-10;000 QR /month + MIDDLE CLASS accomadation 8;000 QR + SCHOOLING 2000 qr a month . That makes around 20;000 QR in total. you may back-calculate any anticipated savings. As to the car; credit business help getting whatever car you may dream and that cost 2000-3000 QR /month for you to own a 2009 Model -luxuary car . Don't forget annual vacation; family airtickets and medical insurance costs.... Good Luck</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Abu Dhabi is the best choice. This is true that these days it is difficult to find accommodation but if you ask your employer to provide you with the accommodation this will be the best solution. I am sure you will never regret the decision.Abu Dhabi has a future with so many real projects in pipeline and specially for a Quantity Surveyor with UK experience this job can be the base for other better opportunities. Good luck and go for it. Take my advise dont focus on present cost of living as these are highly volatile and misleading when I decided to come over in Doha April this year; it was based on good savings but in realty I found it other way round. I think when deciding about taking a job in Gulf; criteria these days should be better opportunity and quality of life and these two things no other city in Gulf provides except great Abu Dhabi.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>hello; I'm a Biomedical Engineer hired by unistaff also last June 12; 2012. I got a call from unistaff that my visa is already with them. I went for my medical last Sept. 20; 2012. They told me that they sent my passport to the Qatar Embassy for Visa Stamping. After 1 week they called me and told me that my passport with the visa stamp is already in POEA for OEC. Today (Oct. 9; 2012) they called me and asking me to go to their office for the PDOS. Tom. (Oct. 10; 2012) will be my PDOS. My colleagues (also Biomedical Engineers) already have their plane tickets; they will leave on Oct. 13; 2012. I am hoping to leave sooner also (CROSSED FINGERS! :D). Patience is virtue.. I believe whining/complaining/getting angry/making endless calls to Ms. Marie will do us any good. Let's just wait for them to call us. Holding our papers/visa/passports won't make them richer neither won't make them any happier; those papers will just stack up in their office. They are just following the right process so.....</RelCText>

			<RelQSubject>Did PMP add value to your career?</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>While I am preparing to take the PMP (Project Management Professional) certificate it popped up in my mind to drop this question to QL community. Did the PMP bring any added value to your career development? either by adding more professional skills to you or helped you to find a better/well paid job?</RelQBody>

			<RelCText>A PMP certificate is not worth the paper it is printed on. Employers want experience; a construction/project management degree and evidence that you started a project and completed a project. I have reviewed many cv's and the majority of people with PMPs have simply not delivered projects; they have been involved; spent a long time ghetting all sorts of qualifications but when you ask them about the basics of project management their lack of practical; varied experience; shines through.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>In my opinion it is good. I've been working as a PM n doing reasonably well.. but on taking the PMP course; I discovered loads of information on how U can better do the job. That there is more to PM than the traditional ways adopted. Especially since its done in a structured n organised manner and in international terms which ppl fr all over can understand and identify with. Having the PMP will empower U to take on PM jobs more confidently. Of cos experience also counts. I am curious how these so called PMPs got their certificate if they cant even vouch for some basic experience. All depends on individual dedication. I wud say go for it. Good luck.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>my first trainset was also TOMY; that was 10years ago; which i handed over to my son which for now; only pieces of plastic tracks remains. i've got my first german model last year which is a starter set. i think its better that both you and your husband will be doing this hobby. What I am doing is that; i am the one who is in charge of the trains while my wife is the one who's constructing the models (stations; bridges; etc..).

			<RelCText>A few of the choices you need to answer before you get started are: What scale would you want to work with? What era or region of train type? How much space do you have for a layout? The two most popular scales are HO and N gauge; they would have the most accessories available for building a layout. With N gauge you could make a nice little layout on a desktop size area or smaller. With HO scale; you would need at least 2 desktop sized areas to make a small layout on.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>there are a couple of 'pure' gyms i know of SAS Gym and Gold's Gym (this one you may not know of it unless you are American) which cater for the gym freaks ... the latter gym i believe is spoofed in Dodgeball (w/ Ben Stiller and Will Farrell) However; there are a few that are health clubs which is what you are after in your description they are:- Al Dana Club Diplomatic Club Doha Club (but closing soon) and clubs in major hotels Intercon Ramada Ritz Sheraton etc plus Al Sharq Ritz Carlton opening soon and some other hotels I think most are pretty full. Prices for singles range from 3000qr to 8000qr per year appr. Do not know of any with climbing walls. Can I ask do the numerous stadiums have gyms that can be used. Also; somewhere like Aspire; can you use any of the facilities there? PLus; many housing compunds have all these facilities ... the quality depends on the compund offcourse; some are real nice such as Mirage; Al Fardan; Beverly Hills; Tbah etc some not so.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Don't hate me diamondgirl....this certainly does not apply to everyone....but my personal experience here in doha is that MOST do not speak english. Even people who are not local and come from the subcontinent and claim to speak english do not understand you or prove able to articulate their thoughts in english. I'm not trying to upset anyone; but i'm calling it like I see it. This is a true story: I called the information number provided on the Qatar Foundation website to get some information on the American universities you hear so much hype about; and was shunted through 4 different people who could not speak english! This isn't an obscure gvt office in the ministry of islamic studies or whatever....this was QATAR Foundation!! SO: No! English is not a main language in Qatar...and is mostly spoken by the European and North American Expat communities only. Stay safe all. Perfection does not exist. The question therefore; is: what level of imperfection are we willing to settle for?</RelCText>

Now not wishing to offend anyone but Arabic and English are the main business languages; however; Indians have derived their onw english after the British left and even I have difficulty understanding many of them. Wen I go to a shope and there is and Indian salesman I have to aske at least three times what he is saying ans this is meant seriously; there are other whose English is wonderful. Most people in Government positions are well versed in English although I have to admit we there are a nuber of employees who speak very little English. You seem to have encountered the very few that don't speak english. May I add this comment here; many more Arabs speak English than English speaking races speak Arabic.</RelCText>

There you can find out dunebashing companies; Where Qatar Bowling Center is (near Mannai RAB); the phone # for paintball at Villagio.

			<RelCText>When you go from Khalifa Stadium towards corniche; reach the firestation roundabout; take a right. You will get Athel;tes village on the right. Keep going straight and you pass a roundabout. Immediately after is an underpass. Dont go to the underpass; but take the road on the right of the underpass. You reach another roundabout. take a u-turn and come back and take the second right turn. You go directly onto the entrance of the bowling centre. Now about the price; It is the cheapest in the middle east. It is QR 10 for the first game and QR 8 for each subsequent games ( i am not sure about it). On Fridays and other weekends; you may have to book in advance. Its a lovely place with 32 international quality lanes. they have cafeteria and free internet access via wi-fi. Its a rockin place; though not many people know about it. For bookings etc; contact: Ph: 4353054; 4329132; 4329140 or 4329178.

			<RelCText>Most decent towers will have a pool as well as possibly a tennis court. Or you could join one of the nearby hotel clubs. The villa compound life is more suited towards families. Think suburbia vs. city life. It can easily take 45 minutes to get from Villagio to West Bay. Traffic is the #1 headache in Doha.</RelCText>

			<RelQSubject>Gap Store in Villagio (Qatar)</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>For all of you shoppers out there. On July 31; a GAP store opened in Villagio. It is at the end of the canal near the ice skating rink. The best part is; the prices are comparable to the original stores in the States. I just wanted to let everyone know. Also; a Banana Republic is opening soon in Villagio. Maybe an Old Navy is next?</RelQBody>

			<RelCText>Don't worry; Qatari's do a good job of wearing fashionable clothes as well as traditional clothes :) I don't really like GAP; but I do like their stretch shirts (which I like to wear under a t-shirt). If their prices are the same as the US; then I'm happy! In the UK; their prices are crazy!!! __________________________ I Love Qatar - http://www.iloveqatar.net</RelCText>

			<RelCText>And another point to note is that sizes which will actually fit Western people often don't fly off the racks as quickly in other countries. I loved going to Gap in Japan; as I could find clothes which actually fit me in the clearance section; without paying an arm and a leg. Normally I don't shop at Gap either; but it became a must-visit whenever I saw one. Can't wait to visit the Villagio again-- they took me to the Middle Eastern restaurant in Villagio for dinner on my second visit day; and then we strolled around for a bit afterwards. The whole Venice motif rocked!</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Braids is not such a big problem. Once I spoke to a kenyan lady who works for Qatar Airways; and she said there are lots of girls who do it (not in a barber's shop; but at home). Finding out who can do braids is easy; just ask (or better let your wife ask) someone with nicely done braids; who did it for them The problem is that my wife wants to stop using braids and do hair relaxation; treatment etc. In other words a professional.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Some little barber shops dotted around Al-Sadd; cheap and they will give you lots of attention; haircut; shave and sometiimes pull your fingers till they crack.   I go to this place and they switch the tv to the english tv for me to watch and sometimes shout for a tea.   True the haircut might not be great or good but its a fun little adventure and much more exciting than going to the fancy hotels barbers; plus it supports my local businesses of Al-Sadd.

			<RelCText>"Hi; thanks for all the ideas of where to have my next haircut! If won't be at Patrice! I went to Patrice at Villaggio and was deeply disappointed. They charged QAR 75. The price wasn't what I was after; I just wanted a decent cut! I'd call my session there HAIRCHOP! The guy who did my hair was not involved for a more than a minute trying to find out what I wanted and this is the worst cut I had since my mother did a ""pot cut"" for me when I was 5 or 6 years old. The Filipino hair dressers carried on a loud conversation between themselves discussing their personal problems; living arrangements etc. "</RelCText>

			<RelCText>The best hairdressers are at Riviera gardens; UK trained. However; sadly; I have given up on them because I live in Dukhan and can only go on Saturdays and they are so often off sick I can't get my appointment. If you take a midweek appointment you will be pleased with the result. For me; after many cancelled appointments; I have forced my poor husband to watch haircutting videos on Utube until I can get back to the Uk for a decent cut.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"Do NOT go to Coiffure Francaise. I went in with very curly hair and asked Marie Claire; the hair dresser; to cut off ONE inch. She cut at least two inches off the overall length. I already had long layers and she asked me if I wanted layers and ended up cutting VERY short layers. She also cut the very front much shorter than the rest of my hair and then straightened the whole thing. I can not wear it curly because it looks REALLY bad. I have to spend extra time straightening my hair; and it's not growing quickly at all. I can't put it in a pony tail yet; and she cut it three weeks ago. If you see a girl around Doha that looks like she tried to give herself ""the Rachel"" at home; that's me. :("</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Clearly you should be careful of the words that you use in a forum; because they can be easily taken out of context. By saying Islam in Qatar is a farce; are you attacking Islam; the Muslims; the people; the institutions...? The non-Muslim banks; and hotels that allow 2 of the biggest societal problems to occur have the blessing of the government... so whose problem is it; Islam's or the state's? And; although many think lightly of the 2 problems of Interest and Alcohol; society in Qatar ALL benefit from the laws that prevent alcohol consumption and their effects in public (if you doubt it; go to any UK city centre on Friday night).

			<RelCText>Thank you all for your insights and hope that my query will not create any conflict; argument or whatsoever to anyone of you. As my husband &amp; I were formerly working in Abu Dhabi; UAE and had also experiences availing loans from 2 banks. One from his side on a fixed interest rate &amp; on my side; on a floating interest rate (which I believe is just the same as variable interest rate). Both of which; we had no question about or might probably; from where I got my loan; they have different way of reflecting the added amount in my monthly statements or I was not given enough time to discover about that as I had to settle the loaned amount after just 2 months of availing it as we decided already to move here afterwards.</RelCText>

Also using their Master Card (credit card) gets you miles with Qatar Airways which you can use for travel. And there services in last 5 years of my being a customer has been excellent.

			<RelCText>Dear and beloved brother in Islam; it is not the concept of banking per say which is forbidden in Islam; but it is the concept and dealings of ‘riba’ which forms the very back-bone of conventional interest-based banks; which is absolutely forbidden in Islam by Allah and His Messenger (saws). The Islamic Banks or Islamic Financial Institutions are all based on Shariah-compliant interest-free dealings; and it would be absolutely permissible for a believer to seek employment in an Islamic Bank; if he wishes to do so. Islamic way of banking: Most people are so used to the conventional interest-based banking system; that in their ignorance of the laws of Shariah-compliant Islamic Economics they may at times accuse the Islamic Financial Institutions of dealing in interest or ‘riba’ with just a different name. A simple example can be cited to make the concept of ‘haraam’ and ‘halaal’ clearer. If one marries a woman and satisfies his pleasure; it is considered ‘halaal’ and .....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Dear people in Islam thankyou every one of you for your valuable answers. i did a little research on this topic and i came to know that; no matter whatever the banks are. if their capital has riba involved in it and if the banks are dealing with riba ; then the business is haram. it depends on what they are dealing with. for example - all ''Q'' companies are dealing and doing business with some product so their business is halal but when some company does liquor and riba and other haram things involved in it ; then it becomes haram. i also found this that: in olden days the trade used to take place between products like rice for wheat; or rice for milk or rice for sugar or other dealings which is halal; then came currency : wheat for dirhams; dirhams for rice which still is halal but when the currency came in like 1 kg of good quality gold for 3 kg of bad quality gold and people started this thing and started to cheat in this currency to currency to gold to gold ; or good quality wheat.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>The best bank in Qatar for you would be the one that fits in your requirements.I suggest you visit the major banks here; and approach the Customer Relations person there to guide you with the facilities the bank offers.

I found out that QNB and CBQ are very dynamic; gives you a lot for cheap. My needs are: -Free Current account with no minimum balance with 2 debit card -Good credit card with airport lounge and added benefit -0% payment plan at good retaillers -Excellent mobile and internet banking -Cheap ATM and transfer for abroad... For the above; QNB and CBQ are the best. But it really depends on your salary too. IBQ is not very good. QIB is ridiculous.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Sheabi; the reason behind it; is that most people in QL have very low income; hence everytime a bank will take them a penny even a very justified one for a rendered service they will call them robbers...Also bank may not have the same level of service if you earn 2000 or 25000... I would advise you to find a the right branch and the right customer service agent; and stick to him to build a relationship.

			<RelCText>I know how it feels. The time for training; preparation for exams and postponement of exams date and all is really frustrating but like someone earlier said confidence during road test; slow driving and observation and following basic rules will do you alot. The trainers give too many rules to follow but on the exams day; the policeman wants to see your confidence and application of basic control moves. That's all. I wish you the best.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I also have driving licence(from home country) and go for short course but after having pre-test (which is not mandatory)they forced for full course and according to other student it is their practice especially for short course student and important is they never tells students about such so called pre-test at the time of admission after having few classes they inform you about pre-test which is unfair........ while with karawa after completed the classes you can go directly for test with police department(which is quite normal).</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Notice rodqie76; he mention that they forcibly or tactfully impose long/full course through so called pre test;and they refuse students to go for the test with traffic department; and after giving admission fee no one think to go any other institute.

			<RelCText>So we are at the same point that they are good for long course or full course but not having qualified instructor who can teach in certain time and therefore they enforce through pre-test to go for full course. In case any student wish to go for test then they refuse even they didn't allow to submit the exam fee of that student while other institute doesn't have such they follow the proper rule by traffic department;while they are having their own sub-rule. Point is if traffic department allows for short course or direct test why they take pre-test and enforce for full course. It is good only for those who are not sure either they can drive properly or not!!!not for all......... any way Congratulations you got your licence after having full course.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Good point razingbull.....but the question comes in mind about the credibility and quality of rest of the institute!!!!and in that case the leverage given by traffic department is just waste because they allow such students to go directly to the TEST..........not enforced pre-test.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"You are lucky Razingbull......if these are quality measures why they are hiding at the time of admission if someone insist to pay exam fee at the same time they said you will pay three days before exams.....why they are showing such double standards;if they are quality conscious then must inform to students ""if you pass pre-test then institute allows you to go for test if you agree then take admission"" other wise they are over ruling the permission given by government/traffic department which allows for direct test or short course."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>If you have a valid driving license from your country of origin; you can drive a rental car for a period of seven days. However; if you have an INTERNATIONAL DRIVING LICENSE; THERE IS NO TIME LIMIT. Before the seven-day period is up; you will need to get a temporary driving license that is valid for the period of your visa. All nationalities may exchange their country of origin's license for a temporary Qatar license; however you may not do so if you have already started the residence visa process. If this has been started; you will have to wait for the visa before applying for a permanent license. To obtain the temporary license; you will need to apply in person at the Madinat Khalifa Traffic Department; where you will be required to complete an application form. This will have to be completed in Arabic (there are a number of typing shops within the confines of the traffic department who will assist; for a small fee).

Some people has no driving license driving around Doha and when they meet accident they run and leave their vehicles because they can be in a serious trouble in this country! or Some people are driving legally using their International Driving License but in process of the local Driving license as you cannot avoid it; you should apply for the local one too! In my case; before having the local driving license; I was depending on my Int'l Driving license; since I arrived here for at least 7 to 8 months; I had an accident and had my Resident Permit and showed it to the traffic police and voala! my car is fixed back to it's beauty!

			<RelCText>I would suggest Dr Najeeb Al-Nauimi (he is a former minister of justice) be very penitent and talk to your sponsor. If your sponsor is powerful and your job is important you might get away with it. Otherwise you may have to go to jail for one to four weeks and then you will be deported. I know a couple of people who have gotten away with it and one person who was deported. You will not get whipped (unless you are a muslim). Good luck. Just call me Tigasin.

			<RelCText>warning to some ladies out there. there are companies who will only assured you that they have female visa but then at the end of your current visa they will tell you we can't issue visa and goodbye. and worst is like what happened to my friend; she was hired then the company said that they are already processing her visa. but the one month tourist visa was over yet there's no visa yet. so she was asked to go out from the country and get another tourist visa because according to the boss it takes time to process the visa. but she was wondering so she tried to talk to the mandoob and found out that they have no female visa available. quite embarrassing.... they are taking advantage to some poor individuals.....</RelCText>

			<RelQSubject>Expat wives in Qatar</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>Hi everyone; Very nice to meet you all. :) My wife and I are moving to Doha in about 3 weeks. As I'm going to be working most days; my wife and I are a little concerned about what she'll be able to do to keep her occupied during the day. We were thinking of getting her enrolled at an ESL school (she doesn't speak much English). Besides take courses; what do other non-expat spouses do to keep busy? Thanks everyone. Hope to meet some of you after we arrive!</RelQBody>

			<RelCText>Hi! Nice to meet you; hope your move goes well. It can be difficult finding things to occupy your time here; especially when you're new. I'm not sure where you're going to be living? I live in an apartment block with my husband and it has no communal areas so have found it hard to meet and get to know my neighbours. I think compound life is a bit more sociable? Anyway - a couple of ideas... The Intercontinental Hotel (the one near Katara; not Intercont. the City) has a special offer on Tuesdays and Wednesdays - ladies pay only 50 QR to access their pool / pool area. I take yoga classes with Yama Yoga http://yamayogastudios.com - they are lovely and might be another way to meet people? Also; not sure what nationality / language your wife speaks but there are a number of associations for different nationalities here. Buy a copy of Marhaba magazine when you arrive - they have an up to date list of them with contact details - so she could socialise with people who speak her language.</RelCText>

If she know painting or tailoring she can earn bit extra money by doing. If she had done any beautifican course she can join in any of the parlour.

I know it all might depend on the country of citizenship; the degrees... but it could be nice to have at least an idea about what to expect; some raw numbers...

			<RelCText>"Dr S; I have checked with a friend doctor at Hamad Hospital; and these are some feedbacks that I gather : 1. HMC plans to become a full fledged Specialist Hospital soon; therefore they don't take in Residents anymore. Anyway; there is an exception to this...if you're enrolling the ""Arab Board"" Program; you'll be appointed as Resident. ""Arab Board"" is a 4-year program to become Specialists. 2. To enroll the Arab Board; HMC together with Weill Cornell Medical College conducts a yearly entrance exam (normally in Sept). In the recent exam; the passing mark was 55. 3. Salary for Resident is about QR 8;200/month (excluding Housing). 4. If you have relevant experience and qualifications; you will either be appointed Clinical Associate/ Specialist/ Consultant."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Saving money... good advice always!! Luckily Doha is a bit more about an adventure for both of us actually. We realized as comfortable as we were in the States; we were playing it a bit safe with Life. It's not that money isnt nice (it is) but the numbers are letting us pursue a bit of housing fun at the same time. Since my offer wont let me convert housing to a per diem I either spend it or lose it. Sooooo we're shopping around for the lifestyles of the not so rich but certainly shameless ;) Thanks Mandi; will check out West Bay Lagoon. Cristiani is already pressing me for the Pearl and since I'll be at the Airport; betting I'm in for a 30-45 minute commute already....

			<RelCText>since you are working at the airport; check the villas at Al Fardan 1. It would only be a short commute. It it on D-ring road across from LuLu Hypermarket. I have been here for 5 years and seen a lot of different compounds. Al Fardan 1 has the most beautiful pool area and the villas are HUGE! They even have 5 bedroom villas with private pools in the backyard. By the way; it can take almost an hour to go from West Bay Lagoon to the airport in morning traffic. I know from experience.

			<RelQBody>Hello everyone; A fairly straightforward question for you all: what type of jobs typically command a salary of 30-40k QAR per month (allowances are in addition to this salary) in Qatar? I'm from the UK and have applied for a job that has this salary. I think it's pretty awesome (please correct me if I am wrong) and was just wondering how it compared with other jobs. Thanks very much in advance for your help.</RelQBody>

			<RelCText>QF has a standardized classification level that ties in with pay. The pay level depends upon the needs of the job; not on your qualifications. $25K QR plus benefits is actually a really high classification level; i think as a Senior Manager / Director type of position. $16;000 QR is more than many teachers make in Doha; so I would think that is probably a good salary; but again it depends on the job. The Housing and transport allowance makes up for any salary discrepancies you might encounter. QF is pretty fair about pay; and is an employer of choice in Qatar.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>As a result many brands sometimes appear like they've been removed completely until they get around to restocking them.....which takes WAY too long for some reason.

			<RelCText>Anjas; i said Carrefour...  Ragnarock; i know what u mean; but it is just weird that all the products from this brand were suddenly not available... so i don't think it was the issue of stocking up. and as Fembot said; they won't say why those products are no longer available.

			<RelCText>But like I said with other brands (though maybe with not as WIDE a range of products) they have gone missing for a LONG time then suddenly showed up....so we are forced to do the stockpiling thing when they ARE available LOL...sad; but this is how its done here if you want to ensure you don't run out of the brands you like. The best advice I can give you is ask to speak to a manager (in the admininstration department; not just a floor section manager in the store) next time you are there; and inquire about the brand specifically. And IF for some reason they did stop carrying it; you should be able to find them in other stores (unless the whole country decides to ban them for whatever reason). Hope that helps. Stay safe.

			<RelCText>Good; at last no more plastic bags littering around. They charge the thinner plastic bag for 15 cents (whatever in local currency) and I know for the sturdier bag (the one that cost QR2) you can change in the customer service once it's broken or damage. I changed mine last week and they changed it without any question.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Another one of these questions written most probably by a Qatarbeautyshop employee/owner with the answer being reference to Qatarbeautyshop in the first 3 posts... It is not difficult to find small and extra small sizes in Qatar. As for Qatarbeautyshop; i'd personally would not buy clothes online unless i've tried them out - and i'm a guy. Women are more picky. Moreover shopping in malls/window shopping is one big pastime in Qatar - sorry but your business may not be that feasible in Qatar. Nevertheless wish you all the best however please stop these posts - it is very cheap and does not look good for your business.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"The W website says January; but word on the street is early spring. Looking at how fast La Cigale is opening; it more then likely won't be till late spring. It's the first of something like 14 starwood hotels that will be opening in the next couple of years. W is a boutique hotel; which means that all the furniture and stuff is for sale. Cool eh. :) Just google W for more information; I promise you won't just get a bunch of Bush sites.

Don't be amused by this word (The World's Local Bank); they are right in it's local; but it's not universal. you can ask them about something to do with another HSBC world wide; they will tell you: sorry; there is no networks between our banks in the world; so it's just local bank. I'm telling you this; since I'm dealing with five different bank in Qatar; and HSBC was even lower level than others; it's just a big name; the only good thing about them; that they provide you parking in the main branch in Banks street. I think Doha; Almashreq; and the commercial banks are better options. Best regards</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Hmmm Red Pope - well my friend was neither drunk nor obnoxious; and was celebrating with his wife and other friends. He actually rents a villa at Garvey's. Had just bought a bottle of champagne ready to see in the New Year when the police arrived. He had to leave it there so was a bit pissed off!! The DJ was telling people to leave; that it was not a joke. Maybe your friend was drinking at one of the houses/apartments on Garvey's compound?</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"You must also remember what was originally on the site of the Mall in the old arport area. That massive and squalid shanty town. The Center was the only decent large shop and it had BHS as one of its franchises although many of the items for sale were not BHS products; just BHS labels sewn on in the wrong place. There was a Shwarma stall in the car park and a cafe inside that served many dishes. Both were operated by ""The Caravan"". The only other shop of any size was Salam Studios; on Al-Saad Street. Now the site of the QP offices and HSBC. Salam Plaza didn't open until the early/mid 80's I seem to recollect. If there was something that you wanted and couldn't find; Globe China was the place to go."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>growing up I don't remember any traffic jams!!! Life was calm and peaceful...I do remember going with my Mum to the souq for shopping (spices; perfumes; material for clothing; nuts; etc) Now they deliver to us! But we still go once in a while. I remember going to Europe a few times a year (staying in our houses in London and Paris and travelling around) and we would always have a long list of things to buy and take back. Clothes; shoes; medicines; foodstuffs...endless list. Now the list is shorter as there is so much more available to buy in Doha and online buying with shipping is easier. Some of my older relatives remember Doha as a walled city with a curfew at night. Someone came along to light the gaslamps (?) at sunset and during Ramadan someone came through the streets at Suhoor time to wake everyone up to eat before the fasting began for the day. Dweller; you've got a good memory...I had forgotten about Salam Studios on Al Sadd St. My Dad used to shop there a lot. I remember when.....</RelCText>
